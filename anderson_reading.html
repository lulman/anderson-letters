         ¤ <a href="#WBA_18620616_let">Letter from Anderson to his wife, Louisa, 16 June 1862</a><br><p>Anderson writes home to Louisa from Cincinnati, Ohio. He is hauling Coal Boat men
            from Louisville, Kentucky. While in Cincinnati, Anderson visits his mother-in-law
            (whom he calls the "old lady") as well as family friends. During the dry, dusty,
            June weather, a fire breaks out near the Ohio River and Third St, destroying several
            houses. Anderson closes the letter by inviting Louisa to accompany him on his next
            trip to Cincinnati.</p>
         ¤ <a href="#WBA_18620627_let">Letter from Anderson to his wife, Louisa, 27 June 1862</a><br><p>Writing from Pittsburgh, Anderson tells Louisa that his boat's departure has been
            delayed by a day 
            and asks her to send some food and clothes to him at the dock in Shousetown, PA. He
            also expresses 
            anxiety about whether his trip will be profitable and asks his wife to request 
            some money from a Mr. Russell to help cover an upcoming payday for his crew.</p>
         ¤ <a href="#WBA_18620711_let">Letter from Anderson to his wife, Louisa, 11 July 1862</a><br><p>Anderson writes that he hopes his boat will beat riverboat Fanny McBurney to
            Maysville, KY in order to realize more profit on the trip, though he thinks his "prospects
            are poor" and is concerned
            about delays due to low water. He complains that his sleep has been restless because
            of mosquitoes,
            and he asks Louisa to write more—and at greater length—about their children and their
            crops.</p>
         ¤ <a href="#WBA_18620728_let">Letter from Anderson to his wife, Louisa, 28 July 1862</a><br><p>Anderson discusses details of his trading and shares reflections on the war, including
            a group of
            prisoners aboard his riverboat and his sense that the war is "far from over."</p>
         ¤ <a href="#WBA_18620810_let">Letter from Anderson to his wife, Louisa, 10 August 1862</a><br><p>Anderson complains of low water on the river, reports on a visit to Louisa's mother,
            and assures her that he is unlikely to be drafted as long as he is "in part
            in the government employ" transporting soldiers and government freight.</p>

            threatens his prospects of profiting from government trade and favorable prices. He
            also describes the scene at Gallipolis where he boarded soldiers bound for induction
            into the army at Camp Portsmouth: "it would have made the hardest heart melt to have
            heard the woman [sic] and children weeping on the wharf Boat."</p>

            been repaired and he has considered but rejected several offers to buy it. He notes
            that he had to give a one thousand dollar "Bail" to leave Pennsylvania and had to
            promise to return "by the 3rd of next month if drafted." He describes the enthusiasm
            of recruits boarding the train at small stations all along his return route to
            Cincinnati, but he also notes the women and children bidding the recruits goodbye
            and lamenting the distress "that this war has brought on the human family."</p>

            no family, yet at the same time stresses that he "will never go unless compelled"
            and would do so primarily "in defence of my own property and for the preservation
            of

            the home farm. Apparently in response to Louisa's claim that he is "indifferent

            sides of a loose sheet of manilla-colored, unlined paper measuring approximately 7.5
            inches wide by 12.5 inches tall (20 x 32 cm). The left edge of the sheet is slightly
            ragged, while the other three edges are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn
            from a notepad or bound notebook. It appears originally to have been folded twice
            crosswise and twice lengthwise. At this writing, the ink appears
            brown. A .5-inch by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed
            watermark appears in the upper lefthand corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3
            cm) from the top edge and .25 inches (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark
            is indistinct, its shape closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and
            positioned watermark on a letter dated July 18, 1863, which reads "OWEN &amp;

                wants us and at good prices we were pressed

            <p>
               I arrived here yesterday at 6 in the 
               Morning &amp; Found the crew all well and the Boat 
               nearly repaired we are all ready for business 
               and have a load engaged and will leave here 
               tomorrow for Gallipolis and may if there is water 
               go on up as far as Parkersburg and take the 
               Freight that we left at Racine the time we 
               broke our Shaft. I have had various opportunities 
               of Chartering or selling our Boat but none that 
               I would accept. we will stand a better chance 
               on our return to sell or Charter if the river still 
               continues to fall. Our expenses for repairs have been 
               considerable though not as much as I had anticipated 
               I caught the old lady &amp; Ella in bed yesterday 
               morning when I went in to see them. I went in 
               and ran upstairs as I usually do and found 
               the doors open and the old lady laying on the Sofa 
               and Ella on the floor both sound asleep and the 
               bed standing as it has stood since I first went 
               down there while the Kenton was in the Memphis 
               Trade. Though I suppose it is their choice and of 
               cource [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                we have no business to say a word, they are 
               both well I promised to go down to day &amp; see them 
               and shall this evening. You ought to have seen 
               me in Pittsburgh the day I left I had to get 
               a pass 
               
               to leave the state and give One Thousand 
               Dollars Bail that I would return by the 3rd of 
               next month if drafted. I don’t fear any 
               such thing as being drafted though may 
               be for there is no telling what there will be 
               to do yet, the eccitement [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                has abated to a great 
               extent here since I left though all along the R

                is beyond bounds in the night

               as Andersons Ferry 8 miles we made but two yesterday
               one at noon and one in the night all is quiet here
               now and the majority of the stores are open but there
               is nothing doing but what appertains to the war it
               is thought that there will be a Battle in Kentucky
               someplace soon but as it will not be in the vicinity
               of the River I will not get a chance of witnessing
               it I have heard so much of war and been so much
               among soldiers that I have lost all horrors that I
               used to entertain about war I would as soon go
               to war as not if I were stout and had no family
               for it has almost became a fashion to go all that
               are left out of the military ranks are old and
               decripped [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
               , and it seems as that it has became [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                a 
               necessity to turn out.  I will never go unless compelled
               to and that in defence of my own property and for
               the preservation of the Union  I am sure that the South will
               be completely broken up and the north greatly in
               debt though the debt will be amongst the north
               and the money will be left in the country and all
               will be benefitted more or less with it.

               I have not seen your mother since I last wrote
               to you as I have to stay on the Boat I have no
               opportunity of seeing any body or any thing only soldiers

                poor I have not
               tasted any Butter for 4 weeks that I could stand and
               as for sauce we never have any thing of the kind we
               have Beef poor at that and Bakers Bred [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                and the poorest
               Kind of vegatibles [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                I ever saw all kinds of
               marketting [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                is due
               and poor the Country is as dry as a chip for all we have
               showers frequenty yesterday and last night and today
               is as warm a time as we have had this summer and the
               mosquitoes are the worst I ever saw.  I wish you would
               Call on John Russell and tell him you want some
               Money and keep all that you know to be good such
               as U.S. and all Pittsburgh Banks I fear that I shall
               fail to get all out of him if I don’t make frequent calls
               you must let on to him that you are in need or he will
               put you off.  Tell all the children that I am not
               in war nor do I intend to go that I will come home when
               the river raises and that I have some things for them
               I have a fine lot of Peach stones and wattermellon [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                seeds
               saved and I will go up town some of those days after
               bussiness [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                resumes more fully and buy each of them some
               thing that will please them. I have thought frequently
               about  our whereabouts and pleasures nine years
               ago, and how as you thought what may our position
               be nine year from now.  I hope that we may have no
               more to mar our happiness than we have had and
               that we may both live and our children live many nine
               years to come.  I will stop as my paper is full I will
               look for a letter from you on receipt of this and hope to
               hear of you and the little ones enjoying good health and happiness

                of Uncle Sam while I am here if all goes
                well. I suppose Mr Walsh  might as well
                Hole what potatoes you  dont want
               in the Cellar down in the field where they
               are and secure them by a fence around there

               when I will be back home now but may
               accidentally get home sooner that I look
               for  it has the appearance of rain this
                morning and if water comes to let larger Boats

               if I can only get what I now get and have
               health I would like to stay here a good
               while and then when I go home to stay there

            <p>
               As I have found out what we
               are to do for a little while I let you know
               this morning we were ordered to go below the Bridge
               and go in our old trade that is to go in the dispatch
               bussiness [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                and we still carry our Gun Squad of
               Eleven Men we have just made a trip down to the 
                J B Gurly at Andersons ferry &amp; back &amp; found all well 
               on board though a little excitement down that way
               Some shooting was heard back in the country and
               a dispatcher sent out to asscertain [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
               
               the cause and
               I look for an answer back such as has occurred
               lots of times before that there was a review and shoo of Blank cartridges by way of stimulating the Men
               at hearing the cracks &amp;c. I have good reason to
               expect that we will be soon discharge as I have
               heard that all Boats in Gov service will be dismissed this week unless there should be an attack
               made by the rebels I find that the Comadore is
               dissatisfied at some of the boats engaged in the
               flottilla and the intention is to call all in and
               dismiss all, and such as are absolutely needed he
               will renengage [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                again.  I feel safe that we shall
               fare well and if there is any money to be got out
               of the chartering bussiness [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                we will fare too You
               may think that this is a strange sort of life  
               
               
               
               and so do I!  I cannot tell today what
               I shall do tomorrow nor can a I find out by
               enquiry as the Comadore [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                of the fleet is subject to
               the orders of Gen Wright. I suppose you heard
               by the papers of the cowardice of Capt Adams
               and the Capt of the Florence Miller who are both in
               Jail and likely to be Kept there I don’t Know

               I have no news of any interest to write to
               you I have not seen your mother since last
               Saturday week she was well  I have not
               had any letter from you for over a week
                and it worries me are you sick or are you
               mad or are any of the children sick let me
               hear from you often.  I witnessed a funeral
               persession [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                on last Saturday of one of James Loves
               children at Maysville and it struck me sorely
               to see it as he and us were both married on the
               Same day and have had the same number of children and they lack but a little of being of the same
               ages and he lost the youngest one a boy of the same
               size and near the same age of Eddie it made me
               feel very queer indeed as I had not heard from
               you when at Cin last  I wish you was here or I
               Could go up and stay at home a while but that
               is out of the question.  Kiss all the children for
               me and tell them to be good that I will soon
               Come home take good care of yourself good

               Yours Mailed 13th I got on my 
               arrival to the City this afternoon &amp; was glad 
               to hear from you.  I have been absent from 
               the City for a few days on a trip to Maysville 
               we are still in Gov employ and I suppose we 
               will continue some time yet as there is no prospect 
               of water.  I will have to be dissapointed [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                in 
               my prospects of going home for while and 
               if you can come down I will be glad to 
               see you any time you can come you had better 
               not attempt to bring the children as they will 
               be to [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                great a charge for you, although I should 
               be very happy to see them but you could not be 
               at liberty to go any place you might wish with 
               them and there is no reason why you could not 
               leave them in care of Mary McNamee and Julia 
               Porter for that time.  You can make your own 
               arrangements about the children as I leave the 
               care of them altogether to you I think if you 
               will come down 
                you
               had better not wait as long as next month 
               for fear the river will raise or if it dont [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                
               raise &amp; should continue to fall we might be sent 
               down below. this  
               my advise [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                to you will be 
               for you to come by the Steubenville route and 
               
               
               
               leave Pittsburgh at one Oclock or there abouts 
               and when you get on board you tell the 
               Conductor that you want to take the sheeping [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                
               Car which they take in tow at Steubenville 
               and that will cost you 50 cts extra that train 
               arrives at the Dayton &amp; Hamilton Depot at about 
               5 or 6 oclock A.M. the ticket office is on 
               Liberty Street near the Canal on the left hand 
               side of the street it might be that John 
               will come down with you and that would 
               be better as I think he has acted very foolish 
               for I have to pay 5$ each per day for Pilots 
               and he might just as well had 200$ dollars 
               while he has been at home as not if you should 
               come down or have any chance to send me 
               that pair of Blue Pants &amp; belt down I would 
               like to have them as my Pants are getting thin 
               and I don’t want to spend any money I can 
               help.  I have not seen your mother for 
               2 or three weeks I may see her in a few 
               days if you come let me know a few days 
               before you come when to be on the look out 
               for you.

               Tell Old Man Walsh that I will take 12 
               dolls for that Heifer &amp; for him to sell the Hay 
               and divide the money I think hay will be very 
               High in the spring but I suppose he wants his 
               share of the money he can do as he thinks 
               best about it.  That Bank notice you spoke 
               
               
               
               about I made arrangements with Holmes 
               &amp; Sons Brokers to pay all my notes that will 
               fall due I told Mr Wright to use what Money 
               was deposited at Holmes &amp; Sons belonging to the Boat 
               to Pay Notes &amp; when that ran out to use what 
               I had there which is sufficient to pay all claims 
               that may fall due for a while I will look 
               for a letter from you soon and will be 
               pleased to hear of you making satisfactory arrangements to come and see me 
               as it seems utterly impossibly for me to 
               leave for the present I am to settle up 
               our business here up till the 15 of this Mo 
               this or next week and then I will find out 
               what I am making but one thing I do 
               know is this that I am doing as well as I 
               want to with a boat my share of the proffits [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                
               and wages is at least 40 dolls per day and that 
               is not bad but keep it to yourself. I will stop 
               as the mail Closes at 8 Oclock this evening I 
               will write soon again but write immediately

            <p>
               I will commence a letter to you 
               this afternoon &amp; Finish it tomorrow we arrived
               here last night about Midnight we had
               a fair trip around &amp; if we get as good a one
               back we will make a little money times are very
               dull &amp; and prices poor we had all the freight we could 
               carry on the water I have several small lots engaged
               to go back to  Louisville &amp; Cin. &amp; I think by Monday
               night we shall have all we can carry I had thought
               somebody would be here and offer to buy the boat but
               the Boat fervor has subsided greatly I had a visit
               from Capt R C Gray today &amp; he says that he thinks that
               the upper Mississippi river trade would pay us better
               than the St Louis and Cin. trade but I dont wish to go up 
               there for the present. I had an offer at Cin. to sell &amp; I will
               know what I can do when I return if the party accepts my
               offer I will be home Shortly.</p>
            
            <p>
               Sunday Evening I have been rather under the weather
               since I left Louisville &amp; had today to have a 
               Doctor &amp; he gave me a lot of Medacin [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                and as
               Soon as I took of it got better he says I would 
               have had the ague or a bad attack of Billious 
               fever if I had not had relief soon I thought
               it was the Neuralgia I had, for one side of
               
               of my face &amp; jaw pained me constantly
               and my teeth ached &amp; I had one of them 
               pulled and it did not do any good and
               for 48 hours I had not eaten one bite nor
               slept one minute.  I was not well one minute
               at a time until I took the medicine and it
               acted like a charm I am of course weak
               but feel well and tomorrow I want to go 
               and see Belle Ferguson I have not been out
               of my room nor in fact out of Bed all
               day till this Evening. I would not have
               believed that a few doses of medicine would
               do so much in so short a time.  I will
               send you a paper or two tomorrow I
               hope you are well give my love to 
               the children excuse this poor letter
               for I can assure you that I have had 
               letter [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                to say – I will leave here for
               Cin tomorrow night without I get
               disappointed. I have been unable to go 
               up town to see how it looks but will
               tomorrow if nothing happens &amp; my 
               health improves I feell [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                sure I will
               be all right again in a day or two

            on both sides of a loose sheet of manilla-collored, lined paper measuring
            approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches tall (19 x 23 cm). The paper is ruled
            with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch
            (3.8 cm) top margin that is unruled. The sheet's left edge is ragged, the remaining
            three clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or from a larger
            sheet. The letter appears to have originally been folded once horizontally and twice
            vertically. An embossed watermark appears in the upper left corner of the
            sheet; though indistict, it resembles a similarly sized and placed watermark on
            a letter dated July 1, 1863, that reads: "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."</p>

            <br>Dear Wife
            
            
            <p>
               I take my pen to let you know
                that I am well.  we  arrived here on Friday
               Morning and had to go over to the other side
               of the river and about a mile up Licking
               to put out our Metal and had a terrible 
               time getting unloaded the Irish in this town
               are all on a rioting spree and wont work
               nor let any body else work we made a
               Contract with a party to put our load off
               for 15 cts per ton and when we got to the
               place to unload refused to work and then
               all our Deck hands but 2 quit and would
               not work so we sent over to Cin. for more
               men and the Irish would not let them
               cross on the ferry Boat so we had a good time
               to get our load out but finally succeeded
               and got back out of licking and to the
               Wharf here about 10 Oclock at night and
               yesterday took all the Frt. we could get for
               Pitt and will I think by tomorrow Evening
               have a load we have now on and in sight
               half enough.  but the divel [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                has broke loose
               over in Kentucky again last night the Mayor
               Received a dispatch to send all the Forces
               
               
               
               
               that could be got over to go out to Lexington
               as Morgan and 3000 men had Burned down
               Lebanon and were likely to take Lexington
               and the City was all one uproar last
               night and to day the Mayor then ordered
               all the Police 200 in number to start at
               2 Oclock with as many more citizens as
               can be procured to go out on a special train
               I was up to a meeting on the public square
               on 5th street and could not get to hear one
               word in ten that was spoken while I was
               there there was a dispatch arrived to  [Morgan
               Hatch?]  to send on men and arms to save
               the city as Lexington was in iminent [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                danger
               as for Louisville they had enough to do
                to take care of it them selves and Cin.
               Must save Lexington  I think I never saw
               as wild a people as all in Cin. are today
               I don’t think that the danger is as great
               as is anticipated  I think that all this is
               done to get recruits and then they will march
               them on to Richmond but be it as it may it
               thus played the very mischief with business in
               the city for a few days.  I was down to see the
               old Lady to day and Ella came up with me
               and is on the Boat now and is well the old
               lady is well I have some Pears the old lady 
               sent you.  I will take Ella and put her
               
                           
               on the street cars and send her down home and
               mail this if nothing more happens than I know
               of at this time  we will be up about Friday
               or Saturday our trip will not be as good
               as the last on account of our down trip
               being so poor  tell Mary McNamee that Wm
               is now on the boat on a visit and is well
               I will buy a Half Barrel of white sugar and
                put off as we go up is [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                I can get it right
               everything is high and money scarce Gold and
               Silver is from 10 to 15 per ct better than paper
               money here  I will go up on 5th st tomorrow
                and see  Sue Whitake [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                as I have to pass where
               she is on my way to the Lead factory on 9th
                st  I have engaged 60 tons of Lead and but
               about half of it is down yet &amp; I have to see the
               shipper tomorrow to let him know definitely about
               our time of leaving I will stop as I have no

                Your of 26 came in due time &amp; I
                was pleased to hear from you &amp; hope you &amp; all the
                little ones are well I send with Elias4 60$ Dolls
                as he is going home to stop off till his health
                gets better I will see your Mother this
                Evening I have been very buissily [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]
                engaged
                all day &amp; have not had one moment to
                myself I &amp; the boat are pressed in Gov.
                service or rather chartered at 150$ one
                hundred &amp; Fifty Dolls per day &amp; our fuel
                furnished which is as good or better than
                I could do out of the service our trip
                around was rather poor having only
                picked  but little by the way we
                have made in all since the boat came
                out six thousand clear cash though that
                is not bad in less than two months I hope
                to be able to make enough by the setting in
                of winter to remain at home &amp; enjoy the comforts of our own fireside though things change often
                I had almost despaired when we arrived here and
                all of a sudden I happened to strike a luckey [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>]

                that I now
                am engaged in we will leave tomorrow
               
                Evening for Nashville with 220 Mules and
                about 40 tons of soldier clothing &amp; 40 tons of oats
                It will take us probably 15 to twenty days to
                make the trip &amp; by that time we shall probably
                hear of orders to go some place else or it may
                be that we shall not be permitted to come
                back here again as we are at the Command
                of the Military authorities though one thing certain
                we are not at our own risk if the boat is
                lost we hold the Government for it and the
                way it was before if she was lost it would
                have been our own risk.  I am astonished
                to hear of you not receiving more letters
                from me for I have written to you very
                often 2 the last time I was here and one from
                Nashville and so on all the time I am sure
                I have written at the very least 2 letters per
                week Ever since I left home I hope you
                will get them more regularly as I have
                written &amp; do still intend writing but there
                has been so much trouble about the mails
                on account of the Morgan raid that I suppose
                may account for failure of the mails
                I have but little news to write about
                Kiss all the little ones for me &amp; tell them to
                be good till I come good by till tomorrow I
                will drop you a line before we leave

         <p class="msDesc"><span style="font-weight:bold;">MS Description. </span>Anderson's letter of 14 August 1864 from Cincinnati is written in ink on two sides
            of a loose sheet of manilla-colored paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide
            by
            9.0 inches tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled on the recto side with horizontal blue lines
            spaced .33 inches (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin;
            the verso is unlined. The left edge of the sheet is ragged, while the other three
            edges are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound
            notebook, or a larger sheet. It appears originally to have been folded once
            crosswise and twice lengthwise. An indistinct, embossed watermark appears in
            the upper left-hand corner of the lined side of the sheet. </p>

            <p class="hang15"><a id="nmother"></a>1.&nbsp;Mary Louisa Anderson's mother, Ann (Woolslayer) Fischgens (<cite>History of Allegheny County</cite> 298).<a href="#pmother" class="annotation">

                  </a></p>
            <p class="hang15"><a id="nella"></a>2.&nbsp;Ella Jane Fis was Louisa's younger sister, born in 1851. 
               She died in Cincinnati on September 4, 1863 (Danker, <cite>William B. Anderson Letters</cite>).<a href="#pella" class="annotation">

            <p class="hang15"><a id="nglide"></a>3.&nbsp;Perhaps
               the <cite>Glide</cite>, a river steamer which Anderson eventually sold to the U.S. government (Jordan 506).<a href="#pglide" class="annotation">

            <p class="hang15"><a id="ntyphoid"></a>4.&nbsp;According to information from Anderson descendent Jamie
               Danker, at the time this letter was written the Andersons had four young children:
               William Y.,
               born 1855; Anna Margaret, born 1857; John L., born 1859; and Robert Edward, born 1861.
               A fifth child, Harry C., would be born in January 1865. William, Robert, and Harry
               would all die of typhoid fever in 1890 (Robert and Harry just a day apart), while
               Anna
               Margaret and John survived the disease that year. In a 2005 report, the Water Science
               and Technology Board states that Pittsburgh had the highest national typhoid death
               rate for large cities in the years 1873-1907; before the establishment of an effective
               water filtration system in 1907, the city drew its drinking water directly from the
               polluted Allegheny River (Danker, "Re: Request for permission"; <cite>Regional Cooperation</cite>, 36–37 ).<a href="#ptyphoid" class="annotation">

            <p class="hang15"><a id="nNorris"></a>5.&nbsp;
               This pencilled note appears in the top margin. It was presumably added after
               the letter was composed, but the context is unknown.<a href="#pNorris" class="annotation">

            <p class="hang15"><a id="nMcBurny"></a>6.&nbsp;Presumably the Fanny McBurney (Fanny McBurnie), a Union stern-wheeled steamer built
               at Cincinnati in 1860 (Gaines 94; History of Washington County 379).<a href="#pMcBurny" class="annotation">

            <p class="hang15"><a id="njuly28"></a>7.&nbsp;
               While Anderson does not include the month in his dateline, July was the only month
               in 1862
               in which the 28th fell on a Monday. His reference to "the late news" from Tennessee
               that caused him to
               turn down business opportunities probably refers to the capture of Nashville by the
               Union Army on February 25th,
               followed by the fall of Memphis in June
               (Ash).<a href="#pjuly28" class="annotation">

                  </a></p>
            <p class="hang15"><a id="nsisters"></a>8.&nbsp;Anderson is probably referring to the Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy, 
               incorporated as the Wheeling Female Academy
               under the auspices of the Sisters of Visitation in 1848 ("May 31, 2008: Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy Graduates Last Class").<a href="#psisters" class="annotation">

            <p class="hang15"><a id="nkanawha"></a>9.&nbsp;
               Anderson probably meant to write "Kanawha," referring either to Kanawha City, WV on
               the Kanawha River, which flows into the Ohio at Point Pleasant, OH between Cincinnati
               and Parkersburg,
               or the Little Kanawha River, which flows into the Ohio at Parkersburg.<a href="#pkanawha" class="annotation">

                  </a></p>
            <p class="hang25"><a id="nFrankfort"></a>10.&nbsp;Presumably, Anderson is referring to the Kentucky State Prison in Frankfort, south
               of Cincinnati.<a href="#pFrankfort" class="annotation">
                  [Back]
                  </a></p>
            <p class="hang25"><a id="ndateError"></a>11.&nbsp;Anderson records the day as Sunday, but in August 1862, the 16th fell
               on a Saturday.<a href="#pdateError" class="annotation">

            <p class="hang25"><a id="nJune19"></a>12.&nbsp;June 19, 1863 fell on a Friday, not Saturday.<a href="#pJune19" class="annotation">

            <p class="hang25"><a id="nholmes"></a>13.&nbsp;A lot labeled "Holmes" appears
               at 15 Market Street on an 1872 map of Pittsburg. ( Historic Pittsburgh, https://historicpittsburgh.org/islandora/object/pitt%3A1872p015/viewer).<a href="#pholmes" class="annotation">

               of the Battle of Lebanon places the date of the letter on Sunday, July 5, 1863.<a href="#pLebanon" class="annotation">

            About this View of the Letters
            </h2>
         <p><a id="view"></a> This presentation of the Anderson letters derives from the project's 
            main XML file, anderson_letters.xml, transformed with anderson_common.xsl and anderson_reading.xsl.
            In this "view" of the Anderson letters, line breaks in the
            manuscripts are not reported; rather, lines wrap in the browser's window. Similarly,
            page
            breaks are not reported. Paragraph breaks follow those in the manuscript. Spelling,
            punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as they appear in the
            manuscript. Text highlighted by the correspondents with an underscore is underscored
            in this
            view. Canceled text is suppressed. Text added between lines or in the margins is silently
            incorporated into the reading text. Uncertain readings are enclosed in square brackets
            and followed by a
            question mark, and text supplied by the editor for clarity is set in italics and surrounded
            by square brackets. Links to notes and external materials are superscripted and colored.
