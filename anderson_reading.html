            hauling Coal Boat men from Louisville, Kentucky. 
            While in Cincinnati, Anderson visits his mother-in-law, the 'old lady,' as well as
            family friends. During the dry, dusty, June weather, 
            a fire breaks out near the Ohio River and Third St, destroying several houses. He
            opens his riverboat up as an improptu shelter for the fire
            victims, even filling the typically unoccupied Ladies' Cabins. Anderson closes the
            letter by inviting Louisa to accompany him on his next
            trip to Cincinnati.

            and asks her to send some food and clothes to him at the dock. He also expresses 
            anxiety about whether his trip will be profitable and asks his wife to request 
            some money from [John?] Russell to help cover an upcoming payday for his crew.

            her to write more and to write back regarding business prospects. He is rushed, and

            was 
            glad to hear about her welfare and also to hear about the kids doing well. 
            William says in the letter that the war is far from over even though some people might
            think otherwise. 
            William also ask Louisa to write him back when she gets a chance because from the

            soon. Anderson continues his letter and describes how he feels about boarding soldiers
            on his riverboat. 
            His emotions of grief and sadness overrun the second half of his letter, and he explains
            that he feels terrible watching families be torn apart. Anderson closes with warm

            During his travels,
            it was necessary to build a chute and hire oxen in order to bring the wheat to Blennerhasset's
            Island.  
            In the latter part of the letter, Anderson discusses his hope to sell his boat, as
            business is stopped 
            now that the previous travels are finished.  He finishes by sending his love to his

            over the simpler pleasures in life like Butter [sic] and Beef [sic]. 
            Anderson asks his wife to pay a vist to John Russell in order to collect 
            the money that Russell owes Anderson; Anderson fears that Russell
            will be slow to repay if his wife does not express a strong sense of need.

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated July 11, 1862 from Cincinnati and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on both sides of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 12.5 inches 
            tall (20 x 32 cm). The paper is not ruled as are others in this collection.  
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
            It appears originally to have been folded twice crosswise and not lengthwise, leaving
            a 5 inch middle section without foldes. This may or may not illustrate the size of
            the envelope. 
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
            closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
            mark on a letter dated July 18, 1863, which reads "OWEN &amp; HURLBUT SO. LEE MASS" 
            (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
            the RBML.

                a few Sacks of Oats. I will not go down 
                to see the Old Lady to night as I want
                rest and if I feel not to much fatigued
                by morning I will go down while it is 
                cool it has been exceedingly hot here
               
               
               
                today and I have been very bussily [sic]  engaged 
                and had scarcely any sleep since I left 
                home so I require rest. Bill Whitacre
                came down to the Boat this evening to
                see me he looks very bad has a very 
                long Beard. We had a short talk 
                and he gives a dollfull [sic]  account of

                Sesseshinists [sic]  and others the war is

               are beginning to get plenty we had some
               to eat on the boat this evening that

            <br>My DearWife
            
            
            <p>
                As John is going home I take 
                the opportunity of dropping you a few lines
                to inform you that I am well.  We arrived here
                at noon today we have had bad luck since
                I wrote you last. We broke our shaft on our up 
                trip and shall have to lay here for several
                days to have it mended or probably a
                new one made.  I cannot learn what our
                luck will be in getting it repared [sic]  till Morning
                I will probably get time to go up and see
                you while the reparing [sic]  is going on if I can
                leave with any kind of propriety.  It was one
                of the worst times that an accident could 
                happen as the river is low and Government
                wants us and at good prices we were pressed
                into Gov Service at Gallipolis but were released
                on account of our broke shaft
                We brought down part of 3 companies of 
                soldiers from Gallipolis to camp Portsmouth
                and it would have made the hardest heart
                melt to have heard the women and children
                weeping on the wharf Boat while the men
                were being ordered on board there was at least
                70 women &amp; 100 children there to take perhaps
                the last leave of their husbands Brothers &amp; Sons
               
                
               
                who have answered the call for men
                to try and restore peace and restore this
                once Glorious Country to peace.  You see
                or Know nothing about this war or the
                effects produced upon families  by it
                I am sick and tired of soldiers and soldiering
                we see nor hear but little else and what
                I am most fearfull of is that the end is
                not close at hand we carry every trip more
                or less sick and wounded men and any amount
                of women on their way to look up their sons
                Husbands or Brothers while I am writing the

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated August 16, 1862 from Cincinnati and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
            tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
            (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
            All four edges of the letter, 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was bought as a package of looseleaf. 
            It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge.

               for the Government up to Gallipolis and from there
               we went up to take our Wheat that we left
               at Grahams Station and and succeeded in getting
               up as far as the foot of Blennerhassets Island
               and there we dug a Shute [sic]  wide and deep enough
               to draw a flat drawing but 13 inches over and at
               3 lads got our wheat over and then hired a man
               and a team of oxen to haul the flat of [sic]  and left
               the 2nd clerk there to attend to it  we arrived here
               this morning and will leave at noon for Maysville with a
               load of Mules and then I don’t know what we will
               do though on our return I will write again  I am
               quite busy now but will probably have more 
               to write about when I come back again  I
               may sell the boat I will try to any how [sic] 
                I hope to be home soon and will most

         <p class="msDesc">This document is a letter from Captain William B. Anderson (1822-1897), to his wife,
            
            Mary Louisa (Fischgens) Anderson. He wrote this from Cincinnati, on September 1st,
            1862.  
            It is one page long, with no other notes or enclosures. It is written on lined notebook
            paper, 
            folded in half lengthwise and into thirds after that.  There is no surviving envelope
            that goes 
            with it, and it is approximately eight inches by ten inches in size.  There is a printer's
            mark 
            in the upper-left hand corner, in the shape of a shield surrounded by greenery, with
            a crown on 
            top.  The left edge of the paper is slightly ragged and worn, as if it had been torn
            from a
            composition book or a pad of paper bound on the left.

               &amp; I was glad to hear from you and pleased to learn
               that the the children were well  I am also well and
               am still employed in the same way as a dispatch
               Boat and our trips only extend down as far of late
               as Andersons Ferry 8 miles we made but two yesterday
               one at noon and one in the night all is quiet here
               now and the majority of the stores are open but there
               is nothing doing but what appertains to the war it
               is thought that there will be a Battle in Kentucky
               someplace soon but as it will not be in the vicinity
               of the River I will not get a chance of witnessing
               it I have heard so much of war and been so much
               among soldiers that I have lost all horrors that I
               used to entertain about war I would as soon go
               to war as not if I were stout and had no family
               for it has almost became a fashion to go all that
               are left out of the military ranks are old and
               decripped, and it seems as that it has became a 
               necessity to turn out.  I will never go unless compelled
               to and that in defence of my own property and for
               the preservation of the Union  I am sure that the South will
               be completely broken up and the north greatly in
               debt though the debt will be amongst the north
               and the money will be left in the country and all
               will be benefitted more or less with it.

               as for sauce we never have any thing of the kind we

               is as warm a time as we have had this summer and the
               Mosquitoes are the worst I ever saw.  I wish you would
               Call on John Russell and tell him you want some
               Money and keep all that you know to be good such
               as U.S. and all Pittsburgh Banks I fear that I shall
               fail to get all out of him if I don’t make frequent calls
               you must let on to him that you are in need or he will
               put you off.  Tell all the children that I am not
               in war nor do I intend to go that I will come home when
               the river raises and that I have some things for them
               I have a fine lot of Peach stones and wattermellon [sic]  seeds
               saved and I will go up town some of those days after
               bussiness [sic]  resumes more fully and buy each of them some
               thing that will please them. I have thought frequently
               about  our whereabouts and pleasures nine years
               ago, and how as you thought what may our position
               be nine year from now.  I hope that we may have no
               more to mar our happiness than we have had and
               that we may both live and our children live many nine
               years to come.  I will stop as my paper is full I will
               look for a letter from you on receipt of this and hope to
               hear of you and the little ones enjoying good health and happiness

         <p class="msDesc">This letter in written on a single thin piece of blue-lined paper as the writing on
            the opposite side shows through. 
            The singular, vertical jagged edge on the left side of the paper suggests that the
            paper was 
            torn from a notebook or journal. The paper is approximately 8 x 9.75 inches in dimension.
            
            Anderson wrote the letter in brown ink  and folded the letter three times( once crosswise
            and
            twice length-wise) to create 
            six equally-sized sections so that the letter could fit into one 
            of his standard envelopes. On the bottom of the first page, several words are smudged
            perhaps as a result of
            moisture on the captain's hand from the summer heat or from a rapid writing pace that
            did not allow the ink to dry sufficiently.

         <p class="msDesc">This document is letter number 10 from a man named William B. Anderson 
            that he wrote to his wife, Louisa in September of 1862 from Cincinnati.  In 
            all, there were 26 letters written to Louisa from 1862 to 1864.  This particular
            letter is 2 pages long and is written on loose paper measuring approximately
            7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches tall, lined with blue horizontal lines.  The first page
            of the letter is in pretty good condition.  However, there are numerous brown stains
            that could possibly be dirt.  The second page of the letter is in slightly better
            condition,
            with only a few smudges.  Both pages seem to have been folded, twice long ways
            and once shorts ways.  While the ink is black and legible throughout, there are still
            errors both in spelling and with ink smudges.  The paper William used is a cream 
            color.

         <p class="hang15"><a name="nCin"></a>3.&nbsp;The "2" is somewhat unclear. 
            It resembles a "4". However, later in the letter, the
            author tells his wife to "be sure to write as before" and that he has "enclosed an
            envelope in
            yesterday's letter. The day before (Friday) July 11, 1962 would have been a Thursday,
            whereas the 
            day before (Monday) July 11, 1964 would have been a Sunday. Assuming the author literally
            enclosed and mailed
            a letter containing an envelope, the date must be 1962 as he could not have sent mail
            out on Sunday.<a href="#pCin" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="nMcBurnie"></a>4.&nbsp;The author 
            is most definitely referring to a riverboat. Although the writing is unclear, 
            he may be naming the Fanny McBurnie. If so, he has misspelled the name by replacing
            
            the ‘ie’ with a ‘y’, writing M. Burny. I found no record of a boat that went by such
            
            a spelling. However, the Fanny McBurnie (or McBurney) seems to have existed (need
            citation).<a href="#pMcBurnie" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="nsisters"></a>5.&nbsp;Andersons is probably referring to the Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy, 
            incorporated as the Wheeling Female Academy
            under the auspices of the Sisters of Visitation in 1848.(West Virginia Encyclopedia).<a href="#psisters" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="nchildren"></a>6.&nbsp;At the time this letter was written,
            W.B. Anderson and his wife Lousia  had four children: William Y., Anna M., John L.,
            and
            Robert(298-299).<a href="#pchildren" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="ndateError"></a>7.&nbsp;Anderson records the day as Sunday, but in August 1862, the 16th fell
            on a Saturday.<a href="#pdateError" class="annotation">

               </a></p>
         <p class="hang15"><a name="nglide"></a>8.&nbsp;Anderson built
            the Glide, a river steamer which he eventually sold to the U.S. government.(Jordan506).<a href="#pglide" class="annotation">

         <p><a name="view"></a> In this reading text of the Stephens letters, line breaks in the
            manuscripts are not reported; rather, lines wrap in the browser's window. Similarly,
            page
            breaks are not reported. Paragraph breaks follow those in the manuscript. Spelling,
            punctuation, capitalization, and abbreviations are reported as they appear in the
            manuscript. Text highlighted by the correspondents with an underscore is underscored
            in this
            view. Canceled text is suppressed. Text added between lines or in the margins is silently
            incorporated into the reading text. All material added by the editors is surrounded
            by
            square brackets: uncertain readings are enclosed in square brackets and followed by
            a
            question mark, and text supplied by the editor for clarity is set in italics and surrounded
            by square brackets. Gaps in the manuscript (e.g., from tears) are indicated by elipses
            enclosed by square brackets. Links to notes and external materials are colored.
