            hauling Coal Boat men from Louisville, Kentucky. 
            While in Cincinnati, Anderson visits his mother-in-law, the 'old lady,' as well as
            family friends. During the dry, dusty, June weather, 
            a fire breaks out near the Ohio River and Third St, destroying several houses. He
            opens his riverboat up as an improptu shelter for the fire
            victims, even filling the typically unoccupied Ladies' Cabins. Anderson closes the
            letter by inviting Louisa to accompany him on his next
            trip to Cincinnati.

            their two sons and asks 
            her to write more and to write back regarding business prospects. He is rushed, and

            was 
            glad to hear about her welfare and also to hear about the kids doing well. 
            William says in the letter that the war is far from over even though some people might
            think otherwise. 
            William also ask Louisa to write him back when she gets a chance because from the
            time he gets

            the children are.  He also tells her of his visit to see her mother and that he has
            
            asked John Russell (a local businessman often referred to in Anderson’s letters) to

            while being a riverboat captain.
            He reports that a shaft has broken on the boat, and hopes the new part will arrive
            soon. Anderson continues his letter and describes how he feels about boarding soldiers
            on his riverboat. 
            His emotions of grief and sadness overrun the second half of his letter, and he explains
            that he feels terrible watching families be torn apart. Anderson closes with warm
            wishes to his family

            He brings oats to Gallipolis, Ohio; retrieves wheat from
            Graham's Station, West Virginia, and brings it to Blennerhasset's Island, West Virginia.
            During his travels,
            it was necessary to build a chute and hire oxen in order to bring the wheat to Blennerhasset's
            Island.  
            In the latter part of the letter, Anderson discusses his hope to sell his boat, as
            business is stopped 
            now that the previous travels are finished.  He finishes by sending his love to his
            wife and children.

            encounters with the war thus far. Anderson writes of the
            impoverished life he and his fellow shipmates live and becomes nostalgic
            over the simpler pleasures in life like Butter [sic] and Beef [sic]. 
            Anderson asks his wife to pay a vist to John Russell in order to collect 
            the money that Russell owes Anderson; Anderson fears that Russell
            will be slow to repay if his wife does not express a strong sense of need. 
            Anderson closes the letter optimistically speaking of great times to 
            come with his wife and children once he returns home.

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated June 16, 1862 from Cincinnati and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
            tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
            (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
            It appears to have been folded in half once. Anderson indicates that this letter 
            written in two seperate sessions. A .5-inch by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed 
            printer's mark appears in the upper left- hand corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches
            (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inch (0.6 cm) from the left edge. 
            Although the mark is indistinct, its shape closely matches that of a distinct, 
            similarly sized and positioned printer's mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863,
            which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."

            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated July 11, 1862 from Cincinnati and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on both sides of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 12.5 inches 
            tall (20 x 32 cm). The paper is not ruled as are others in this collection.  
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
            It appears originally to have been folded twice crosswise and not lengthwise, leaving
            a 5 inch middle section without foldes. This may or may not illustrate the size of
            the envelope. 
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
            closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
            mark on a letter dated July 18, 1863, which reads "OWEN &amp; HURLBUT SO. LEE MASS" 
            (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
            the RBML.

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated July 28, 1862 and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
            tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
            (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. On the second page
            
            William writes part of the letter on the left side because he ran out of room.
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
            It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise.
            On the second page, William writes on the side of the page because maybe he was
            running out of room.
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
            closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
            mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated August 10, 1862 from Cincinnati and addressed to
            his wife Louisa 
            is written in ink on both sides of a loose sheet of paper measuring approximately
            7.5 inches wide by 
            10.0 inches tall (20cm by 24.5cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced about
            0.75cm apart. 
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges are clean,
            suggesting that 
            the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook.  It appears originally to have
            been folded once 
            crosswise and three times lengthwise. At this writing, the ink appears dark brown
            and the paper off-white (cream).

             I wrote you last. We broke our shaft on our up

             trip and shall have to lay here for several

             into Gov Service at Gallipolis but were released

             We brought down part of 3 companies of

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated August 16, 1862 from Cincinnati and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
            tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
            (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
            All four edges of the letter, 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was bought as a package of looseleaf. 
            It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge.

         <p class="msDesc">This document is a letter from Captain William B. Anderson (1822-1897), to his wife,
            
            Mary Louisa (Fischgens) Anderson. He wrote this from Cincinnati, on September 1st,
            1862.  
            It is one page long, with no other notes or enclosures. It is written on lined notebook
            paper, 
            folded in half lengthwise and into thirds after that.  There is no surviving envelope
            that goes 
            with it, and it is approximately eight inches by ten inches in size.  There is a printer's
            mark 
            in the upper-left hand corner, in the shape of a shield surrounded by greenery, with
            a crown on 
            top.  The left edge of the paper is slightly ragged and worn, as if it had been torn
            from a
            composition book or a pad of paper bound on the left.

            that the the children were well  I am also well and

            am still employed in the same way as a dispatch

            <br><a name="0010"></a>0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            one at noon and one in the night all is quiet here
            <br><a name="0011"></a>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            now and the majority of the stores are open but there
            <br><a name="0012"></a>0012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            is nothing doing but what appertains to the war it
            <br><a name="0013"></a>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            is thought that there will be a Battle in Kentucky
            <br><a name="0014"></a>0014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            someplace soon but as it will not be in the vicinity
            <br><a name="0015"></a>0015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            of the River I will not get a chance of witnessing
            <br><a name="0016"></a>0016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            it I have heard so much of war and been so much
            <br><a name="0017"></a>0017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            among soldiers that I have lost all horrors that I
            <br><a name="0018"></a>0018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            used to entertain about war I would as soon go
            <br><a name="0019"></a>0019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to war as not if I were stout and had no family
            <br><a name="0020"></a>0020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            for it has almost became a fashion to go all that
            <br><a name="0021"></a>0021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            are left out of the military ranks are old and
            <br><a name="0022"></a>0022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            decripped, and it seems as that it has became a 
            <br><a name="0023"></a>0023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            necessity to turn out.  I will never go unless compelled
            <br><a name="0024"></a>0024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to and that in defence of my own property and for
            <br><a name="0025"></a>0025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            the preservation of the Union  I am sure that the South will
            <br><a name="0026"></a>0026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            be completely broken up and the north greatly in
            <br><a name="0027"></a>0027&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            debt though the debt will be amongst the north
            <br><a name="0028"></a>0028&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and the money will be left in the country and all

         <p class="msDesc">This letter in written on a single thin piece of blue-lined paper as the writing on
            the opposite side shows through. 
            The singular, vertical jagged edge on the left side of the paper suggests that the
            paper was 
            torn from a notebook or journal. The paper is approximately 8 x 9.75 inches in dimension.
            
            Anderson wrote the letter in brown ink  and folded the letter three times( once crosswise
            and
            twice length-wise) to create 
            six equally-sized sections so that the letter could fit into one 
            of his standard envelopes. On the bottom of the first page, several words are smudged
            perhaps as a result of
            moisture on the captain's hand from the summer heat or from a rapid writing pace that
            did not allow the ink to dry sufficiently.

         <p class="msDesc">This document is letter number 10 from a man named William B. Anderson 
            that he wrote to his wife, Louisa in September of 1862 from Cincinnati.  In 
            all, there were 26 letters written to Louisa from 1862 to 1864.  This particular
            letter is 2 pages long and is written on loose paper measuring approximately
            7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches tall, lined with blue horizontal lines.  The first page
            of the letter is in pretty good condition.  However, there are numerous brown stains
            that could possibly be dirt.  The second page of the letter is in slightly better
            condition,
            with only a few smudges.  Both pages seem to have been folded, twice long ways
            and once shorts ways.  While the ink is black and legible throughout, there are still
            errors both in spelling and with ink smudges.  The paper William used is a cream 
            color.

            Some shooting was heard back in the country and

            <br><a name="0045"></a>0045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            children at Maysville and it struck me sorely

            to see it as he and us were both married on the

            Same day and have had the same number of child

            <br><a name="0049"></a>0049&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            ages and he lost the youngest one a boy of the same
            <br><a name="0050"></a>0050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            size and near the same age of Eddie it made me

            feel very queer indeed as I had not heard from

            to hear from you.  I have been absent from

            <br><a name="0008"></a>0008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <br><a name="0009"></a>0009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            will continue some time yet as there is no prospect 
            <br><a name="0010"></a>0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            of water.  I will have to be disappointeddissapointed in 
            <br><a name="0011"></a>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            my prospects of going home for while and

            not attempt to bring the children as they will

            be tooto great a charge for you, although I should 
            <br><a name="0016"></a>0016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            be very happy to see them but you could not be

            at liberty to go any place you might wish with

            them and there is no reason why you could not 
            <br><a name="0019"></a>0019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            leave them in care of Mary McNamee and Julia

            leave Pittsburgh at one Oclock or there abouts 
            <br><a name="0030"></a>0030&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and when you get on board you tell the

            5 or 6 oclock A.M. the ticket office is on

            will come down with you and that would 
            <br><a name="0039"></a>0039&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            be better as I think he has acted very foolish 
            <br><a name="0040"></a>0040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            for I have to pay 5$ each per day for Pilots 
            <br><a name="0041"></a>0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and he might just as well had 200$ dollars 
            <br><a name="0042"></a>0042&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            while he has been at home as not if you should 
            <br><a name="0043"></a>0043&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            come down or have any chance to send me 
            <br><a name="0044"></a>0044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that pair of Blue pants &amp; belt down I would 
            <br><a name="0045"></a>0045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            like to have them as my Pants are getting thin 
            <br><a name="0046"></a>0046&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and I don’t want to spend any money I can 
            <br><a name="0047"></a>0047&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            help.  I have not seen your mother for

         <hr class="half-width">
         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated June 27, 1862 from Pittsburgh and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
            tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
            (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
            It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
            closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
            mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO." 
            (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
            the RBML.

            <br><a name="0006"></a>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            here last night about Midnight we had

            a fair trip around &amp; if we get as good a one

            dull &amp; and prices poor we had all the freight we could

            carry on the water I have several small lots engaged
            <br><a name="0011"></a>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to go back to  Louisville &amp; Cin. &amp; I think by Monday
            <br><a name="0012"></a>0012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            night we shall have all we can carry I had thought
            <br><a name="0013"></a>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            somebody would be here and offer to buy the boat but

         <p class="msDesc">The single folded sheet, yellowed with age, has
            writing on both the front and back in black ink, as well as a printer's mark in the
            upper left hand corner.
            William B. Anderson's letter dated June 19th, 1863 from St. Louis, Missouri, is
            addressed to his wife Louisa and is written in ink on both sides of a 
            loose sheet of off-white paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches
            
            tall (19 x 23 cm).  The paper is ruled with horizontal lines of a blue color that
            are spaced .33 
            inches (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) top margin that is unruled.
            
            The sheet's left edge is not a clean line like the remaining three, suggesting that
            it was
            most likely  torn from a notepad of some sort.  Written in black ink, the letter appears
            to 
            have originally been folded once horizontally and twice vertically. 
            A .5-inch by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper left
            
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge of the paper and .25 inches
            
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the exact origins of the mark is inconclusive,
            it
            resembles a similarly sized and placed printer's mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863,
            that
            reads: "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated July 1, 1863 from Cincinnati and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
            tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
            (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
            It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. It reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO" 
            (see illustration).

            DearWife
            
            
            <br><a name="0004"></a>0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I take my pen to let you know
            <br><a name="0005"></a>0005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             that I am well.  we  arrived here on Friday
            <br><a name="0006"></a>0006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Morning and had to go over to the other side
            <br><a name="0007"></a>0007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            of the river and about a mile up Licking
            <br><a name="0008"></a>0008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to put out our Metal and had a terrible 
            <br><a name="0009"></a>0009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            time getting unloaded the Irish in this town
            <br><a name="0010"></a>0010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            are all on a rioting spree and wont work
            <br><a name="0011"></a>0011&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            nor let any body else work we made a
            <br><a name="0012"></a>0012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Contract with a party to put our load off
            <br><a name="0013"></a>0013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            for 15 cts per ton and when we got to the
            <br><a name="0014"></a>0014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            place to unload refused to work and then
            <br><a name="0015"></a>0015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            all our Deck hands but 2 quit and would
            <br><a name="0016"></a>0016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            not work so we sent over to Cin. for more
            <br><a name="0017"></a>0017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            men and the Irish would not let them
            <br><a name="0018"></a>0018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            cross on the ferry Boat so we had a good time
            <br><a name="0019"></a>0019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            to get our load out but finally succeeded
            <br><a name="0020"></a>0020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and got back out of Licking and to the
            <br><a name="0021"></a>0021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Wharf here about 10 Oclock at night and
            <br><a name="0022"></a>0022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            yesterday took all the Frt. we could get for
            <br><a name="0023"></a>0023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Pitt and will I think by tomorrow Evening
            <br><a name="0024"></a>0024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            have a load we have now on and insight
            <br><a name="0025"></a>0025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            half enough.  but the devil has broke loose
            <br><a name="0026"></a>0026&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            over in Kentucky again last night the Mayor
            <br><a name="0027"></a>0027&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Received a dispatch to send all the Forces
            
            
            
            
            <br><span class="pagebreak">[Page&nbsp;-&nbsp;27

            <br><a name="0028"></a>0028&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            that could be got over to go out to Lexington
            <br><a name="0029"></a>0029&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            as Morgan and 3000 men had Burned down
            <br><a name="0030"></a>0030&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Lebanonand were likely to take Lexington
            <br><a name="0031"></a>0031&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and the city was all one uproar last
            <br><a name="0032"></a>0032&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            night and to day the Mayor then ordered
            <br><a name="0033"></a>0033&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            all the Police 200 in number to start at
            <br><a name="0034"></a>0034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            2 Oclock with as many more citizens as
            <br><a name="0035"></a>0035&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            can be procured to go out on a special train
            <br><a name="0036"></a>0036&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I was up to a meeting on the public square
            <br><a name="0037"></a>0037&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            on 5th street and could not get to hear one
            <br><a name="0038"></a>0038&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            word in ten that was spoken while I was
            <br><a name="0039"></a>0039&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            there there was a dispatch arrived to  [Morgan
            <br><a name="0040"></a>0040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Hatch?]  to send our men and arms to save
            <br><a name="0041"></a>0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            the city as Lexington was in imminentiminent danger
            <br><a name="0042"></a>0042&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            as for Louisville they had enough to do
            <br><a name="0043"></a>0043&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             to take care of it them selves and Cin.
            <br><a name="0044"></a>0044&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Must save Lexington  I think I never saw
            <br><a name="0045"></a>0045&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            as wild a people as all in Cin. are today
            <br><a name="0046"></a>0046&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I don’t think that the danger is as great
            <br><a name="0047"></a>0047&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            as is anticipated  I think that all this is
            <br><a name="0048"></a>0048&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            done to get recruits and then they will march
            <br><a name="0049"></a>0049&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            them on to Richmond but be it as it may if
            <br><a name="0050"></a>0050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            they played the very mischief with business in
            <br><a name="0051"></a>0051&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            the city for a few days.  I was down to see the
            <br><a name="0052"></a>0052&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            old Lady to day and Ella came up with me
            <br><a name="0053"></a>0053&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and is on the Boat now and is well the old

         <p class="msDesc">This three page long letter written by W.B. Anderson on July fifth 1863 is written
            with a 
            brown/black ink on a loose piece of off-white, blue lined paper, approximately 7.5inches
            
            wide by 10 inches long. The letter in its current state is appears as if it was folded
            twice
            vertically and once horizontally. The document was written front and back on 2 sheets
            of 
            paper for a total of 3 pages in length. The page also contains a printer’s mark in
            the upper
            right hand corner of the page which is now indistinguishable. This printer’s mark
            closely 
            resembles other printers marks found on several of Anderson’s letters including the
            letter 
            of 27 June 1862 and the letter of 1 July 1863. On these other letters you can more
            clearly 
            read "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated June 18, 1863 from Cincinnati and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
            tall (19 x 23 cm).
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
            It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. There is no image, only the text "OWEN &amp; HURLEBUT So
            Lee MASS."
            (see illustrations).

(Young?), age seven or eight; Anna Margaret, age six; John L., age four; and Robert Edward, age two. A fifth child, Harry C., would be born in January 1865. Tragically, William Y., Robert Edward, and Harry C. would all die of typhoid fever in 1890 (Robert Edward and Harry C. just a day apart), while Anna Margaret and John L. survived the disease that year. In a 2005 report, the Water Science and Technology Board states that Pittsburgh had the highest national typhoid death rate for large cities in the years 1873-1907; before the establishment of an effective water filtration system in 1907, the city drew its drinking water directly from the polluted Allegheny River.Danker; Regional Cooperation, 36–37."><sup>13</sup></a> I send with Elias4 60$ Dolls

         <p class="msDesc">William B. Anderson's letter dated July 31, 1863, from Cincinnati and
            addressed to his wife Mary Louisa is written in dark ink on both sides of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 10.0 inches 
            tall (19.5 x 25 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
            (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin on the front 
            of the sheet and a 0.9-inch (2 cm) unruled top margin on the back of the sheet. 
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are straight, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook.
            
            It appears to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
            At this writing, the ink appears very dark brown and the paper off-white (cream).
            A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is hard to see, its shape 
            closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
            mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO." 
            (see illustrations), so it is likely this letter was of the same paper supply.  
            The Ohio State University Library's Rare Books and Manuscripts Library
            is currently inaccessible due to its relocation in preparation for renovation, so
            no further information about the original letter is currently available.

         <p class="msDesc">CHECK! William B. Anderson's letter dated June 27, 1862 from Pittsburgh and
            addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
            loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
            tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
            (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
            The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
            are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
            It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
            At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
            by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
            corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
            (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
            closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
            mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO." 
            (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
            the RBML.

            It resembles a "4". However, later in the letter, the
            author tells his wife to "be sure to write as before" and that he has "enclosed an
            envelope in
            yesterday's letter. The day before (Friday) July 11, 1962 would have been a Thursday,
            whereas the 
            day before (Monday) July 11, 1964 would have been a Sunday. Assuming the author literally
            enclosed and mailed
            a letter containing an envelope, the date must be 1962 as he could not have sent mail
            out on Sunday.<a href="#pCin" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang15"><a name="nMcBurnie"></a>4.&nbsp;The author 
            is most definitely referring to a riverboat. Although the writing is unclear, 
            he may be naming the Fanny McBurnie. If so, he has misspelled the name by replacing
            
            the ‘ie’ with a ‘y’, writing M. Burny. I found no record of a boat that went by such
            
            a spelling. However, the Fanny McBurnie (or McBurney) seems to have existed (need
            citation).<a href="#pMcBurnie" class="annotation">

            under the auspices of the Sisters of Visitation in 1848.(West Virginia Encyclopedia).<a href="#psisters" class="annotation">

         <p class="hang25"><a name="ntyphoid"></a>13.&nbsp;According 
            to information from Anderson descendent Jamie Danker, at the time of this letter the
            Andersons had four young children: William Y. 
            (Young?), age seven or eight; Anna Margaret, age six; John L., age four; and Robert
            Edward, 
            age two.  A fifth child, Harry C., would be born in January 1865.  Tragically, William
            Y., 
            Robert Edward, and Harry C. would all die of typhoid fever in 1890 (Robert Edward
            and Harry C. just a day 
            apart), while Anna Margaret and John L. survived the disease that year.  
            In a 2005 report, the Water Science and Technology Board states that Pittsburgh had
            the highest 
            national typhoid death rate for large cities in the years 1873-1907; before the establishment
            of an 
            effective water filtration system in 1907, the city drew its drinking water directly
            from the polluted 
            Allegheny River.(Danker; <cite>Regional Cooperation</cite>, 36–37.)<a href="#ptyphoid" class="annotation">
