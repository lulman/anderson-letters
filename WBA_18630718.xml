                     William B. Anderson's letter dated June 18, 1863 from Cincinnati and
                     addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
                     loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                     tall (19 x 23 cm).
                     The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                     are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                     It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
                     At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                     by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                     corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                     (0.6 cm) from the left edge. There is no image, only the text "OWEN &amp; HURLEBUT So Lee MASS."
                     (see illustrations).

         <projectDesc>
            <p>In this particular letter on 18 July 1863 from William B. Anderson to his wife, Mary Louisa, 
               Anderson is brief and shares only trivial news of his ship and crew with her. A loving father, he also
               asks her to kiss their children for him and for them to be good.  Obviously, Anderson was very much in
               a hurry and while some words are misspelled, others are abbreviated.  Punctuation also seems to be
               the last thing on his mind as he writes this letter because it is seldom used.</p>
            <p>As with all but two of the letters, this particular letter is written from Cincinnati, a thriving town in 1863,
            located on the Ohio River, where Anderson traveled on his steamship transporting various goods between
            St. Louis and Pittsburgh. </p>
               <p>In this particular letter, Anderson laments that he has not recently received any letters from his wife
                  and tells her that he is disappointed. He also shares with her the state of his crew, including illnesses,
               which he blames for being unable to visit her mother. On this trip, his cargo is sutlers goods, which are
                  traditionally goods intended for military use. These particular goods were put into many small packages
                  that kept Anderson and his crew busy loading them on the wharf until late at night. Anderson also shares
                  with his wife the state of Elias, one of the members of his crew. Anderson took him to see Dave Indkins, 
                  who was caring for him.</p>
            <p>Anderson promises to write to Mary Louisa from either Evansville or Nashville, but curiously enough, all
               of the letters we have worked with until this point are either from Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, or St. Louis. He tells
               his wife to kiss the children for him and wishes them well. He shares with her that he wrote to Russell and
               that he sent a statement for his finances. He also tells her to get what sugar she would like from him.</p>
            <p>Anderson gives excuses several times that he is very busy and in the closing of the letter, he apologizes
               for any errors in the letters.</p>
            <p>This particular letter allows us to put into context just some of his daily work as well as some of the goods
               that he carried along the Ohio River. This format of the Anderson letters allows for long-term preservation
               and availability to scholars of war-era letters, riverboat enthusiasts, or historians.</p>
            <p>Anderson's letters to his wife are valuable to history as a primary source of life in the 1860's as a riverboat
            captain. The XML coding in the transcription of the letters makes the letters available to a wide audience when they
            cannot see the actual physical letter and also, it provides information to the reader about some subjects raised by
            Anderson himself.</p>

            <p>Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental
               information allowing for semi-modernized, corrected, regularized, or expanded views included as 
               the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable
               cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
               have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
               versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
               attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
            <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
               or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake

            <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation
               and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and 
               signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.</p>

            <p>In general, this edition follows the Text Encoding Initiative's Guidelines
               for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, XML-compatible edition P4.

               To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
               supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
               the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
               &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
               the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
               image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
               by the Media Manager application.</p>

               •	Explain any revisions to the TEI DTD.
               •	Explain any special naming conventions used in your encoding (for example, the ID
                  attributes of page break elements).

            not share with her his destination, he promises to write to her from either Evansville or Nashville. He also tells
            her that he has prepared the finances and taxes for Russell and for her to get any sugar she would like from him.
            He asks her to kiss his children for him and wishes them well while he is gone. He also apologizes for mistakes
            in spelling and other errors.</p>
