                  <dc:description>William B. Anderson writes home to his wife, Louisa, from Cincinnati, Ohio. He is hauling Coal Boat men from Louisville, Kentucky. While in Cincinnati, Anderson visits his mother-in-law, the 'old lady,' as well as family friends. During the dry, dusty, June weather, a fire breaks out near the Ohio River and Third St, destroying several houses. He opens his riverboat up as an improptu shelter for the fire victims, even filling the typically unoccupied Ladies' Cabins. Anderson closes the letter by inviting Louisa to accompany him on his next trip to Cincinnati.</dc:description>

                  -->   <p>  William B. Anderson's letter dated June 16, 1862 from Cincinnati and
                     addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
                     loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                     tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                     (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                     The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                     are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                     It appears to have been folded in half once. Anderson indicates that this letter 
                     written in two seperate sessions. A .5-inch by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed 
                     printer's mark appears in the upper left- hand corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches
                     (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inch (0.6 cm) from the left edge. 
                     Although the mark is indistinct, its shape closely matches that of a distinct, 
                     similarly sized and positioned printer's mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863,
                      which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."</p>

         <projectDesc>
            <p>This document is the first in a series of letters that William B. Anderson wrote to his wife, Louisa,
                   at the time of  the Civil War. During the war, Anderson piloted steam ships along the Ohio River, carrying
                   freight and passengers alike. At this time, letter writing was the most effective means of communication, and the
                   only way to keep domestic affairs in order.</p>
              <p>The collection of letters penned by Anderson was purchased by the Ohio State Rare
               Books and Manuscripts library. They purchased the letters in an effort to increase
               their collection of wartime letters as well as documents that better illustrate the life-world of 
               the historical periods that the letters were written in. 
              </p>
            <p>The reason for digitizing these documents is that the editors are trying to make these
            documents as easily accessible to as many people as possible. These letters may be of intest
            to historians interested in the Civil War, the Steamship Industry, or even postal historians. These
            potential readers were given the most careful consideration in designing the digital texts. The hope is
            that by making these annotated and edited documents available on the world wide web, that the documents will be "streamlined
            and tailored in the service of ever greater efficiency" (Levy 69). Hopefully, the rich media and annotations
            provided will help make these documents more easily understood while the technology itself makes them
            more widely available to interested audiences.</p>

            <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation

            <p>William B. Anderson writes home to his wife, Louisa, from Cincinnati, Ohio. He is hauling Coal Boat men from Louisville, Kentucky. 
               While in Cincinnati, Anderson visits his mother-in-law, the 'old lady,' as well as family friends. During the dry, dusty, June weather, 
               a fire breaks out near the Ohio River and Third St, destroying several houses. He opens his riverboat up as an improptu shelter for the fire
               victims, even filling the typically unoccupied Ladies' Cabins. Anderson closes the letter by inviting Louisa to accompany him on his next
               trip to Cincinnati.</p>
