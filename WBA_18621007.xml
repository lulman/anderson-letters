            <p>This document is one of a collection of letters housed in
                   The Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State 
                   University.  They were acquired by the library through an independent 
                   dealer.  The letters have been arranged as much as possible in chronological order
               to leave room for other letters which may surface.  </p>
              
               
               <p> The letters were written by William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa Fischgens
                   between 1862 and 1864.  The publication of these documents 
                   is part of a project for Digital Media 569 at The Ohio State
                   University.  The purpose of this project is to provide an online edition of these letters
                  which is accurate to the text and includes outside research about the text.  This edition
               will not replace the letters as there are many aspects of the actual documents which can not
               be replicated with the digital medium (Levy 99).  Instead, the transcript of the 
               text is made available, along with images of the actual letters.</p>
            
                  <p>These letters show the effect of the Civil War on everyday life.  
                   They are personal correspondance between a Riverboat
                   Captain and his wife in the early 1860s.  They show the
                   responsibility placed on individuals, the unreliability of
                   mail, and the loneliness of life on the Ohio River. </p>

            <p>Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental
               information allowing for semi-modernized, corrected, regularized, or expanded views included as 
               the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable
               cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
               have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
               versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
               attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
            <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
               or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake 
               of clarity and encoded with the TEI &lt;supplied&gt; element.</p>
            <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation
               and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and 
               signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.</p>
            <p>The critical apparatus used in particular views of the letters is explained at the bottom of each view.</p>

            <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters
               are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
               convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from
               various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
               evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year,
               month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
               appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style
               sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore
               and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).</p>

               To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
               supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to

               &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and

            <p>In this letter, Anderson reports hearing shooting along the river.  He references two captains
               who were put in jail for cowardice.  He expresses concern that he does not know what his orders will be from
               one day to the next.  He speaks of a funeral of a friend's son in Maysville, and worries that his wife 
               is sick or mad because he has not heard from her.  This letter was written in October, making it one of the latest
                 in the season, possibly indicating unseasonably warm weather or extenuating circumstances.</p>

                                           providing a way to cross the Ohio River just west of Cincinnati.  It is
                                        possible in this case that he is referring to Anderson's Ferry as an area of the river.

                     <note id="n4"> 4. This possibly refers to General HG Wright who was major general of volunteers and commanded the Department of the Ohio
                                            from 1862 to 1863.  General Wright assumed command in August, which would mean that 
                                             at the time of this letter he would have had the job for just under two months.
