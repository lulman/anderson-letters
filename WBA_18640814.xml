                     <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated August 14, 1864 from Cincinatti and addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 10 inches tall (19.5 x ? 25cm) and is unruled. The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream).

         <projectDesc>
            <p>This letter, written on August 14, 1864 by William B. Anderson to his wife is similar in style and content to the 21 other letters he wrote from 1862 to 1864.  These letters,
housed in the collection of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library of the Ohio State University, tend to touch on two broad topics: household correspondence and 
business correspondence.  Mixed in with these topics are frequent mentions of 19th century letter writing conventions and Anderson's appologies for breaking them
due to his frequent haste in writing.  Anderson also writes about the logistics of his trips, which are often complicated by the war.</p>
<p>Much of this particular letter is taken up with Anderson's account of the past few days.  His frustration over both having to hire men to watch his freight
and then being forced to sleep with the tobacco is evident.  In this letter, like many others, Anderson takes care of business with his wife and informs her of
what he has done for their business.  It appears he has paid several people while on his trip and informs, or perhaps only reminds, Louisa that he has left
the money in the "Big Pocket Book".</p>
<p>Another interesting part of this letter is his sentimental request that his wife send him pictures of the children, "I would like you to send me one each of a likeness
of you and the children to look at occasionally." Anderson seems close to his family and, at times, impatient to hear from them.  In several of the other letters,
he mentions that he did not get letters.  In this letter, he goes as far as to give his wife a new address to send letters to so that he may recieve them earlier.</p>
<p>One wonders what happened to Louisa's letters to her husband.  It is likely that he kept them, being so eager to receive them, but also that they have been lost
or perhaps damaged.  It is also likely that Louisa was responsible for the careful preservation of her husband's letters.  The Rare Books and Manuscripts library
of the Ohio State University was able to purchase the letters through a dealer.  They were purchased, in part, because they provided a unique and personal
perspective into the Civil War period of the United States. These letters should be of interest, not only to Civil War historians, but to students of business transactions,
those interested in the history of letter writing, and people generally interested in the time period.</p>

            <p>Anderson informs his wife that he has arrived in Louisville, KY. He reports that a canal was closed and tells his wife that he was forced to
