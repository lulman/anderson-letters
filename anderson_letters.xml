	                 <p>Salutation from letter of 27 June 1862
	                   In some ways, William B. Anderson's short letter of 27 June 1862 to his wife, Mary Louisa, 
	                   typifies the twenty-one letters from William to Louisa that survive in the collection of the 
	                   Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. It addresses three of the 
	                   four broad topics about which he repeatedly writes to his wife during the summers of 1862, 1863, 
	                   and 1864: managing domestic affairs and sustaining familial bonds when family members are 
	                   separated for long periods by great distances; the rhetoric and logistics of mid-nineteenth-century 
	                   correspondence; and the economic, logistical, and physical challenges of the riverboat business, 
	                   especially on a waterway as critical as the Ohio River in the midst of the American Civil War 
	                   (in other letters, Anderson also reflects more broadly on the uncertainties, vicissitudes, and 
	                   suffering faced by civilians and soldiers alike in wartime).</p>
	                 <p>However, this letter is also unique. All but two of the letters were written from Cincinnati, 
	                   a thriving center of commerce on the Ohio River approximately halfway between its source at 
	                   the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and its confluence 
	                   with the Mississippi River a mile or so south of Cairo, Illinois. The remaining letter in the collection 
	                   was written from St. Louis, Missouri&#8212;though Anderson mentions writing from Louisville, Kentucky and 
	                   Nashville, Tennessee as well. This letter was written from Pittsburgh, William and Louisa's home town. 
	                   Presumably, he had been visiting his family and had expected to leave Pittsburgh by the Friday in late 
	                   June when he wrote the letter; he writes to inform his wife of a delay.</p>
	                 <p>As the collection in general reveals, delays were common, caused variously by negotiations over freight, 
	                   water levels on the river, mechanical difficulties, and various military complications. 
	                   Arrangements regarding freight seem to have kept Anderson in Pittsburgh overnight on June 27. 
	                   He wants to secure a full load before leaving Pittsburgh because he "cannot depend upon getting 
	                   any freight below here." He takes the opportunity to ask Louisa to send down "the Can of milk and 2 
	                   jars of lard and my clothes and overcoat." The definite article stands out: <emph rend="italic">the</emph> 
	                   Can of milk. 
	                   One wonders whether, in his habitual haste (on which he often blames poor spelling and handwriting), 
	                   he has simply rushed off and forgotten these items, and Louisa has sent him a note asking what she 
	                   should do with them. In any case, in his haste to send her instructions, he crosses out the next 
	                   two lines of his letter and recomposes them. Characteristically, the life of a riverboat captain 
	                   seems frenetic.</p>
	                 <p>It is also worth noting that he arranges to convey a note to his wife via "some one on the Shore at 
	                   Shousetown." While the Andersons clearly handled much of their correspondence through the U.S. 
	                   mail (he mentions post offices several times, and the collection includes one stamped envelope), 
	                   they often convey both messages and goods through intermediaries traveling by rail or river.</p>
	                 <p>Anderson's closing request constitutes something of a refrain in the letters. He asks Louisa to call 
	                   on a Mr. Russell (probably John Russell, a local merchant) in order to collect money owed him, 
	                   noting that he must meet his obligations on the crew's upcoming payday. Aside from suggesting that 
	                   riverboat captains had to watch their cash flow carefully, this request reminds us that Louisa played 
	                   a key role not only in caring for the Anderson household, including their four children (a fifth would 
	                   be born in 1865), but also in tending to their business interests. Though we have only William 
	                   Anderson's side of the correspondence, the letters reveal many details of Louisa's everyday life as well.</p>
	                 <p>It is Louisa, presumably, whom we have to thank for initially preserving the letters, probably for 
	                   the very common, personal reasons to which David Levy alludes in <title level="m">Scrolling Forward: Making Sense of 
	                     Documents in the Digital Age</title>: "In the privacy of our own homes we are likely to hold on to any number 
	                   of treasures: cards, letters, and notes written long ago, photographs, scrapbooks filled with mementoes 
	                   from an earlier era. We can't throw them out, even if we can't say why. We may look at them rarely or 
	                   not at all, yet still it is somehow comforting to know they are there. It's as if something of 
	                   importance is embedded in their very substance. This has less to do with their information content 
	                   per se than with the emotions they evoke and the personal relationships they signify and embody" (96&#8211;97). 
	                   The Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University purchased the letters in part 
	                   because they fit into a larger goal of acquiring materials that reveal the "common man's view of great 
	                   events," and war letters are one focus of that larger effort (Smith). The collection as a whole, and 
	                   the letter of 27 June 1862 more specifically, should also prove interesting to business historians and 
	                   students of letter writing in American culture (Hewitt). The passing of time has made the everyday 
	                   information in the letters newly valuable, though the letters also retain the power Levy speaks of to 
	                   evoke the emotional fabric of everyday life, especially when it becomes frayed in the course of great 
	                   events.</p>

           <p>This edition represents a series of letters that William B. Anderson wrote to his wife, Louisa,
             at the time of  the Civil War. During the war, Anderson piloted steam ships along the Ohio River, carrying
             freight and passengers alike. At this time, letter writing was the most effective means of communication, and the
             only way to keep domestic affairs in order.</p>
           <p>The collection of letters penned by Anderson was purchased by the Ohio State Rare
             Books and Manuscripts library. They purchased the letters in an effort to increase
             their collection of wartime letters as well as documents that better illustrate the life-world of 
             the historical periods that the letters were written in. 
           </p>
           <p>The reason for digitizing these documents is that the editors are trying to make these
             documents as easily accessible to as many people as possible. These letters may be of intest
             to historians interested in the Civil War, the Steamship Industry, or even postal historians. These
             potential readers were given the most careful consideration in designing the digital texts. The hope is
             that by making these annotated and edited documents available on the world wide web, that the documents will be "streamlined
             and tailored in the service of ever greater efficiency" (Levy 69). Hopefully, the rich media and annotations
             provided will help make these documents more easily understood while the technology itself makes them
             more widely available to interested audiences.</p>

         <editorialDecl>
           <p>Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental
             information allowing for semi-modernized, corrected, regularized, or expanded views included as 
             the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable
             cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
             have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
             versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
             attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
           <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
             or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake 
             of clarity and encoded with the TEI &lt;supplied&gt; element.</p>
           <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation
             and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and 
             signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.</p>
           <p>The critical apparatus used in particular views of the letters is explained at the bottom of each view.</p>
           <p>The XML and XSL files related to this
             edition are all available in the KB.

         <refsDecl>
           <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters
             are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
             convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from
             various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
             evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year,
             month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
             appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style
             sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore
             and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).</p>
           <p>To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
             supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
             the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
             &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
             the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
             image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
             by the Media Manager application.</p>

              <p>William B. Anderson writes home to his wife, Louisa, from Cincinnati, Ohio. He is hauling Coal Boat men from Louisville, Kentucky. 
                While in Cincinnati, Anderson visits his mother-in-law, the 'old lady,' as well as family friends. During the dry, dusty, June weather, 
                a fire breaks out near the Ohio River and Third St, destroying several houses. He opens his riverboat up as an improptu shelter for the fire
                victims, even filling the typically unoccupied Ladies' Cabins. Anderson closes the letter by inviting Louisa to accompany him on his next
                trip to Cincinnati.</p>
            </msContents>
            <physDesc>
              <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated June 16, 1862 from Cincinnati and
                addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
                loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                It appears to have been folded in half once. Anderson indicates that this letter 
                written in two seperate sessions. A .5-inch by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed 
                printer's mark appears in the upper left- hand corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches
                (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inch (0.6 cm) from the left edge. 
                Although the mark is indistinct, its shape closely matches that of a distinct, 
                similarly sized and positioned printer's mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863,
                which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."</p>

              <p>Anderson tells his wife that his boat's departure has been delayed by a day 
                and asks her to send some food and clothes to him at the dock. He also expresses 
                anxiety about whether his trip will be profitable and asks his wife to request 
                some money from [John?] Russell to help cover an upcoming payday for his crew.</p>
            </msContents>
            <physDesc>
              <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated June 27, 1862 from Pittsburgh and
                addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
                loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
                At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
                closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
                mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO." 
                (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
                the RBML.</p>

              <p>Anderson tells his wife that his boat will attempt to beat another riverboat 
                to Murraysville, WV. He explains that his sleep has been restless, inquires about their two sons and asks 
                her to write more and to write back regarding business prospects. He is rushed, and signs off three times.</p>

              <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated July 11, 1862 from Cincinnati and
                addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on both sides of a

                tall (20 x 32 cm). The paper is not ruled as are others in this collection.  
                The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                It appears originally to have been folded twice crosswise and not lengthwise, leaving
                a 5 inch middle section without foldes. This may or may not illustrate the size of the envelope. 
                At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
                closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
                mark on a letter dated July 18, 1863, which reads "OWEN &amp; HURLBUT SO. LEE MASS" 
                (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
                the RBML.</p>

                It resembles a "4". However, later in the letter, the
                author tells his wife to "be sure to write as before" and that he has "enclosed an envelope in

              <p>William B. Anderson's letter was addressed to his wife, Louisa, telling her that he was 
                glad to hear about her welfare and also to hear about the kids doing well. 
                William says in the letter that the war is far from over even though some people might think otherwise. 
                William also ask Louisa to write him back when she gets a chance because from the time he gets 
                back he'll have another letter waiting.</p>
            </msContents>
            <physDesc>
              <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated July 28, 1862 and
                addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
                loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. On the second page 
                William writes part of the letter on the left side because he ran out of room.
                The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise.
                On the second page, William writes on the side of the page because maybe he was
                running out of room.
                At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
                closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
                mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."</p>

                the children are.  He also tells her of his visit to see her mother and that he has

              <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated August 10, 1862 from Cincinnati and addressed to his wife Louisa 
                is written in ink on both sides of a loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 
                10.0 inches tall (20cm by 24.5cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced about 0.75cm apart. 
                The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges are clean, suggesting that 
                the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook.  It appears originally to have been folded once 
                crosswise and three times lengthwise. At this writing, the ink appears dark brown and the paper off-white (cream).</p>

              <p>In this letter, Anderson writes to his wife about his daily tasks and his hardships while being a riverboat captain.
                He reports that a shaft has broken on the boat, and hopes the new part will arrive soon. Anderson continues his letter and describes how he feels about boarding soldiers on his riverboat. 
                His emotions of grief and sadness overrun the second half of his letter, and he explains that he feels terrible watching families be torn apart. Anderson closes with warm wishes to his family
                and that he hopes to hear from them soon.</p>

              <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated August 16, 1862 from Cincinnati and
                addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
                loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                All four edges of the letter, 
                are clean, suggesting that the sheet was bought as a package of looseleaf. 
                It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
                At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                (0.6 cm) from the left edge.</p>

            <lb/> at noon today we have had bad luck since
            <lb/> I wrote you last. We broke our shaft on our up

            <lb/> happen as the river is low and Government

              <p>In this document, William B. Anderson lists his itinerary and the business conducted at each port of call.  
                He brings oats to Gallipolis, Ohio; retrieves wheat from
                Graham's Station, West Virginia, and brings it to Blennerhasset's Island, West Virginia.  During his travels,
                it was necessary to build a chute and hire oxen in order to bring the wheat to Blennerhasset's Island.  
                In the latter part of the letter, Anderson discusses his hope to sell his boat, as business is stopped 
                now that the previous travels are finished.  He finishes by sending his love to his wife and children.</p>

              <p>This document is a letter from Captain William B. Anderson (1822-1897), to his wife, 
                Mary Louisa (Fischgens) Anderson. He wrote this from Cincinnati, on September 1st, 1862.  
                It is one page long, with no other notes or enclosures. It is written on lined notebook paper, 
                folded in half lengthwise and into thirds after that.  There is no surviving envelope that goes 
                with it, and it is approximately eight inches by ten inches in size.  There is a printer's mark 
                in the upper-left hand corner, in the shape of a shield surrounded by greenery, with a crown on 
                top.  The left edge of the paper is slightly ragged and worn, as if it had been torn from a
                composition book or a pad of paper bound on the left.</p>

              <p>In this letter, Anderson shows a bit of emotion as he recounts his 
                encounters with the war thus far. Anderson writes of the
                impoverished life he and his fellow shipmates live and becomes nostalgic
                over the simpler pleasures in life like Butter [sic] and Beef [sic]. 
                Anderson asks his wife to pay a vist to John Russell in order to collect 
                the money that Russell owes Anderson; Anderson fears that Russell
                will be slow to repay if his wife does not express a strong sense of need. 
                Anderson closes the letter optimistically speaking of great times to 
                come with his wife and children once he returns home. </p>

              <p>This letter in written on a single thin piece of blue-lined paper as the writing on the opposite side shows through. 
                The singular, vertical jagged edge on the left side of the paper suggests that the paper was 
                torn from a notebook or journal. The paper is approximately 8 x 9.75 inches in dimension. 
                Anderson wrote the letter in brown ink  and folded the letter three times( once crosswise and
                twice length-wise) to create 
                six equally-sized sections so that the letter could fit into one 
                of his standard envelopes. On the bottom of the first page, several words are smudged perhaps as a result of
                moisture on the captain's hand from the summer heat or from a rapid writing pace that did not allow the ink to dry sufficiently.</p>

            <lb/>Yours Came to hand this morning
            <lb/>&amp; I was glad to hear from you and pleased to learn
            <lb/>that the the children were well  I am also well and
            <lb/>am still employed in the same way as a dispatch
            <lb/>Boat and our trips only extend down as far of late
            <lb/>as <orgName>Andersons Ferry</orgName> 8 miles we made but two yesterday
            <lb/>one at noon and one in the night all is quiet here
            <lb/>now and the majority of the stores are open but there
            <lb/>is nothing doing but what appertains to the war it
            <lb/>is thought that there will be a Battle in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>
            <lb/>someplace soon but as it will not be in the vicinity
            <lb/>of the <rs>River</rs> I will not get a chance of witnessing
            <lb/>it I have heard so much of war and been so much
            <lb/>among soldiers that I have lost all horrors that I
            <lb/>used to entertain about war I would as soon go
            <lb/>to war as not if I were stout and had no family
            <lb/>for it has almost became a fashion to go all that
            <lb/>are left out of the military ranks are old and
            <lb/>decripped, and it seems as that it has became a 
            <lb/>necessity to turn out.  I will never go unless compelled
            <lb/>to and that in defence of my own property and for
            <lb/>the preservation of the Union  I am sure that the South will
            <lb/>be completely broken up and the north greatly in
            <lb/>debt though the debt will be amongst the north
            <lb/>and the money will be left in the country and all
            <lb/>will be benefitted more or less with it.

              <p>William B Anderson tells his wife how he must take soldiers to Augusta, Kentucky.  Anderson reports that 
                he is doing well and that he is happy to hear that his wife's mother is also doing well.  He wants his wife to take care 
                of herself and the children.  He describes when he thinks he may be home and for his wife to take 
                care of the house and the work that needs to be done.</p>

              <p>This document is letter number 10 from a man named William B. Anderson 
                that he wrote to his wife, Louisa in September of 1862 from Cincinnati.  In 
                all, there were 26 letters written to Louisa from 1862 to 1864.  This particular
                letter is 2 pages long and is written on loose paper measuring approximately
                7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches tall, lined with blue horizontal lines.  The first page
                of the letter is in pretty good condition.  However, there are numerous brown stains
                that could possibly be dirt.  The second page of the letter is in slightly better condition,
                with only a few smudges.  Both pages seem to have been folded, twice long ways
                and once shorts ways.  While the ink is black and legible throughout, there are still
                errors both in spelling and with ink smudges.  The paper William used is a cream 
                color.</p>
