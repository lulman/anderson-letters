	                 <p>Salutation from letter of 27 June 1862
	                   In some ways, William B. Anderson's short letter of 27 June 1862 to his wife, Mary Louisa, 
	                   typifies the twenty-one letters from William to Louisa that survive in the collection of the 
	                   Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. It addresses three of the 
	                   four broad topics about which he repeatedly writes to his wife during the summers of 1862, 1863, 
	                   and 1864: managing domestic affairs and sustaining familial bonds when family members are 
	                   separated for long periods by great distances; the rhetoric and logistics of mid-nineteenth-century 
	                   correspondence; and the economic, logistical, and physical challenges of the riverboat business, 
	                   especially on a waterway as critical as the Ohio River in the midst of the American Civil War 
	                   (in other letters, Anderson also reflects more broadly on the uncertainties, vicissitudes, and 
	                   suffering faced by civilians and soldiers alike in wartime).</p>
	                 <p>However, this letter is also unique. All but two of the letters were written from Cincinnati, 
	                   a thriving center of commerce on the Ohio River approximately halfway between its source at 
	                   the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and its confluence 
	                   with the Mississippi River a mile or so south of Cairo, Illinois. The remaining letter in the collection 
	                   was written from St. Louis, Missouri&#8212;though Anderson mentions writing from Louisville, Kentucky and 
	                   Nashville, Tennessee as well. This letter was written from Pittsburgh, William and Louisa's home town. 
	                   Presumably, he had been visiting his family and had expected to leave Pittsburgh by the Friday in late 
	                   June when he wrote the letter; he writes to inform his wife of a delay.</p>
	                 <p>As the collection in general reveals, delays were common, caused variously by negotiations over freight, 
	                   water levels on the river, mechanical difficulties, and various military complications. 
	                   Arrangements regarding freight seem to have kept Anderson in Pittsburgh overnight on June 27. 
	                   He wants to secure a full load before leaving Pittsburgh because he "cannot depend upon getting 
	                   any freight below here." He takes the opportunity to ask Louisa to send down "the Can of milk and 2 
	                   jars of lard and my clothes and overcoat." The definite article stands out: <emph rend="italic">the</emph> 
	                   Can of milk. 
	                   One wonders whether, in his habitual haste (on which he often blames poor spelling and handwriting), 
	                   he has simply rushed off and forgotten these items, and Louisa has sent him a note asking what she 
	                   should do with them. In any case, in his haste to send her instructions, he crosses out the next 
	                   two lines of his letter and recomposes them. Characteristically, the life of a riverboat captain 
	                   seems frenetic.</p>
	                 <p>It is also worth noting that he arranges to convey a note to his wife via "some one on the Shore at 
	                   Shousetown." While the Andersons clearly handled much of their correspondence through the U.S. 
	                   mail (he mentions post offices several times, and the collection includes one stamped envelope), 
	                   they often convey both messages and goods through intermediaries traveling by rail or river.</p>
	                 <p>Anderson's closing request constitutes something of a refrain in the letters. He asks Louisa to call 
	                   on a Mr. Russell (probably John Russell, a local merchant) in order to collect money owed him, 
	                   noting that he must meet his obligations on the crew's upcoming payday. Aside from suggesting that 
	                   riverboat captains had to watch their cash flow carefully, this request reminds us that Louisa played 
	                   a key role not only in caring for the Anderson household, including their four children (a fifth would 
	                   be born in 1865), but also in tending to their business interests. Though we have only William 
	                   Anderson's side of the correspondence, the letters reveal many details of Louisa's everyday life as well.</p>
	                 <p>It is Louisa, presumably, whom we have to thank for initially preserving the letters, probably for 
	                   the very common, personal reasons to which David Levy alludes in <title level="m">Scrolling Forward: Making Sense of 
	                     Documents in the Digital Age</title>: "In the privacy of our own homes we are likely to hold on to any number 
	                   of treasures: cards, letters, and notes written long ago, photographs, scrapbooks filled with mementoes 
	                   from an earlier era. We can't throw them out, even if we can't say why. We may look at them rarely or 
	                   not at all, yet still it is somehow comforting to know they are there. It's as if something of 
	                   importance is embedded in their very substance. This has less to do with their information content 
	                   per se than with the emotions they evoke and the personal relationships they signify and embody" (96&#8211;97). 
	                   The Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University purchased the letters in part 
	                   because they fit into a larger goal of acquiring materials that reveal the "common man's view of great 
	                   events," and war letters are one focus of that larger effort (Smith). The collection as a whole, and 
	                   the letter of 27 June 1862 more specifically, should also prove interesting to business historians and 
	                   students of letter writing in American culture (Hewitt). The passing of time has made the everyday 
	                   information in the letters newly valuable, though the letters also retain the power Levy speaks of to 
	                   evoke the emotional fabric of everyday life, especially when it becomes frayed in the course of great 
	                   events.</p>

           <p>This edition represents a series of letters that William B. Anderson wrote to his wife, Louisa,
             at the time of  the Civil War. During the war, Anderson piloted steam ships along the Ohio River, carrying
             freight and passengers alike. At this time, letter writing was the most effective means of communication, and the
             only way to keep domestic affairs in order.</p>
           <p>The collection of letters penned by Anderson was purchased by the Ohio State Rare
             Books and Manuscripts library. They purchased the letters in an effort to increase
             their collection of wartime letters as well as documents that better illustrate the life-world of 
             the historical periods that the letters were written in. 
           </p>
           <p>The reason for digitizing these documents is that the editors are trying to make these
             documents as easily accessible to as many people as possible. These letters may be of intest
             to historians interested in the Civil War, the Steamship Industry, or even postal historians. These
             potential readers were given the most careful consideration in designing the digital texts. The hope is
             that by making these annotated and edited documents available on the world wide web, that the documents will be "streamlined
             and tailored in the service of ever greater efficiency" (Levy 69). Hopefully, the rich media and annotations
             provided will help make these documents more easily understood while the technology itself makes them
             more widely available to interested audiences.</p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
           <p>Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental
             information allowing for semi-modernized, corrected, regularized, or expanded views included as 
             the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable
             cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
             have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
             versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
             attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
           <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
             or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake 
             of clarity and encoded with the TEI &lt;supplied&gt; element.</p>
           <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation
             and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and 
             signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.</p>
           <p>The critical apparatus used in particular views of the letters is explained at the bottom of each view.</p>
           <p>The XML and XSL files related to this

           <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters
             are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
             convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from
             various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
             evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year,
             month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
             appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style
             sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore
             and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).</p>
           <p>To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
             supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
             the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
             &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
             the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
             image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
             by the Media Manager application.</p>

              <p>William B. Anderson writes home to his wife, Louisa, from Cincinnati, Ohio. He is hauling Coal Boat men from Louisville, Kentucky. 
                While in Cincinnati, Anderson visits his mother-in-law, the 'old lady,' as well as family friends. During the dry, dusty, June weather, 
                a fire breaks out near the Ohio River and Third St, destroying several houses. He opens his riverboat up as an improptu shelter for the fire
                victims, even filling the typically unoccupied Ladies' Cabins. Anderson closes the letter by inviting Louisa to accompany him on his next
                trip to Cincinnati.</p>
            </msContents>
            <physDesc>
              <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated June 16, 1862 from Cincinnati and
                addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
                loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                It appears to have been folded in half once. Anderson indicates that this letter 
                written in two seperate sessions. A .5-inch by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed 
                printer's mark appears in the upper left- hand corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches
                (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inch (0.6 cm) from the left edge. 
                Although the mark is indistinct, its shape closely matches that of a distinct, 
                similarly sized and positioned printer's mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863,
                which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."</p>

              <p>Anderson tells his wife that his boat's departure has been delayed by a day 
                and asks her to send some food and clothes to him at the dock. He also expresses 
                anxiety about whether his trip will be profitable and asks his wife to request 
                some money from [John?] Russell to help cover an upcoming payday for his crew.</p>

              <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated June 27, 1862 from Pittsburgh and
                addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
                loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
                At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
                closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
                mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO." 
                (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
                the RBML.</p>
