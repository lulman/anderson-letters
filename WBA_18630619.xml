                     <p>This letter, penned around June 19th, 1863, contains the information shared between husband and wife
                     concerning the former's job as a river boat captain, the unpredictable nature of river trade, and
                     a summation of the captain's bout with illness. The single folded sheet, yellowed with age, has
                     writing on both the front and back in black ink, as well as a printer's mark in the upper left hand corner.  Along with 
                     previous and subsequent letters, Anderson's June 19th writing helps to form a cohesive image of everyday life.</p>

                     William B. Anderson's letter dated June 19th, 1863 from St. Louis, Missouri, is
                     addressed to his wife Louisa and is written in ink on both sides of a 
                     loose sheet of off-white paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                     tall (19 x 23 cm).  The paper is ruled with horizontal lines of a blue color that are spaced .33 
                     inches (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) top margin that is unruled. 
                     The sheet's left edge is not a clean line like the remaining three, suggesting that it was
                     most likely  torn from a notepad of some sort.  Written in black ink, the letter appears to 
                     have originally been folded once horizontally and twice vertically. 
                     A .5-inch by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper left 
                     corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge of the paper and .25 inches 
                     (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the exact origins of the mark is inconclusive, it
                     resembles a similarly sized and placed printer's mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, that
                     reads: "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."

            <p>In the words of David Levy, "no document, no genre, is an island" (29).  This certainly rings true for the letters of
             W.B. Anderson.  The transcription of Anderson's private letter to his wife serves to reveal insight into aspects of daily
             and personal life in the 19th century.  Because Anderson exists as a model of the 19th century average man, the 
             letter allows us to understand the unreliable nature of riverboat business, illness, medication, and the struggles of maintaining
             a marriage that is separated by distance - all factors that were unavoidable for many 19th century families.</p>
            <p>The translation of his words as they appear on paper are significant indicators of the degree
             of education an individual such as Anderson would have experienced.  Furthermore, by examining the span of time and
             distance between the captain's letters to his wife, we are able to better understand the scope of a career on a 19th
             century riverboat.  Anderson frequently insisted that his wife reply to his letters soon - the infrequency of her writing is 
             indicative of both the realities of her busy life and the unreliable nature of the early American postal system (Hewitt).  
             Additonally, the letter allows us to have insight into the illnesses and ailments of the day, which, judging from the subject 
             matter of the letter, were frequent and persistent realities to the life of a riverboat captain.  Anderson lists several maladies that plagued
             him - ague, bilious fever, and neuralgia - and discusses how these complicated his daily work at length.</p>

               the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable
               cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
               have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
               versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
               attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
            <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
               or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake

            <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation

            <p>In general, this edition follows the Text Encoding Initiative's Guidelines
               for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, XML-compatible edition P4.

               To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
               supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
               the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
               &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
               the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
               image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
               by the Media Manager application.</p>

               •	Explain any revisions to the TEI DTD.
