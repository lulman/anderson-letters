                     <dc:description>This short William B. Anderson letter was purchased by the Rare Books Collections at The Ohio State University and was written on August 1, 1863. It provides a fine example of nineteenth century letter writing, letters that often contained personal comments, business logistics, and financial information. One can get a sense of the frenetic life of a riverboat captain at this crucial time in the history of the United States. The primary purpose of this electronic edition is to make available, to those with internet access, several "translations" or versions of an otherwise fragile and relatively inaccessible object that might be of interest to postal, cultural, transportation, or war historians around the world (Hewett, 2006).</dc:description>

                     <p>In this one-page, hurried letter to his wife--which followed  a longer letter just the day  
                     before--Anderson suggests many things about the times and activities on the riverboat. He mentions the transport of 
                     animals (200 mules) along with personal commitments: Anderson met
                     his wife's mother and Ella (an unknown relative or friend) on the boat (Glide II) and was about to leave for dinner. 
                     Before the afternoon departure, he was also intent upon sending business funds to his wife and money for family expenses: 
                     All this in one page on lined notebook paper with little punctuation and a postscript anticipating 
                     a subsequent letter from Nashville.</p>

            <p>In this letter, Anderson is rushing to prepare for "dinner" with his mother and sister-in law while anticipating
            thethe boarding of 200 mules onto his riverboat. In this one-page letter he is dispatching business and personal funds 
               for his wife while anticipating a "4:00 or 5:00" departure for Nashville. It seems to be the equivalent 
            of a hectic email, instant message, or cell phone call in today's (May 15, 2006) world. 
            </p>
            <p>In many ways, this letter reveals what David Levy calls "the invisible infrastructure" or "behind-the-scenes work" 
            that maked this form of communication so very important during this period of history (158). Levy suggests that 
            by looking carefully at mundane documents like cash register receipts and personal letters, we are closer 
            to understanding that "this world-making, or culture-making, business is an immense effort, every ongoing" (159). 
            </p>
            <p>Many simple observations surface in this short letter. We see paper marks on some ruled notebook paper that has been
               torn out and mailed. We can make out, possibly, some partially erased notes on the back of the document. In this letter 
               we see hurried abbreviatoins, short hand, and 
            missing punctuation that we often lament and associate with  our current younger generation's transactional prose 
               via text messaging, email, and
            instant messaging. This letter illustrates the "hurry" and the need for efficiency that resulted from a busy 
               lifestyle that existed 143 years before. One is tempted to extrapolate from these observations that the
               American psyche might be to blame for this type of discourse, and not the generation or individuals who 
               demonstrate hurried comminicative styles. </p>
               <p>We can also imagine the value that others (his wife)
            place on such documents: a financial value clearly, as he mentions both business and personal finances, but 
            also the comfort of mundane daily personal correspondence in a time of great uncertainty and even danger (as other letters 
                  suggest).</p>

            <p>Anderson shoots off a short letter announcing a dinner with his wife's mother and Ella 
            (as yet an unknown relative or friend mentioned in several of Anderson's letters). 
            He suggests that the boat (Glide II) will leave that afternoon from Cincinnati for Nashville with 200 mules 
            aboard. He sends by Adams Express $3600 for business-related expenses (Adams Express was a very profitable 
               delivery company started in the 1850s and had parallel systems of delivery in the south during the war (Pixley, 2002).
               and reminds his wife that he sent $60 for family expenses with the previous letter.</p>
