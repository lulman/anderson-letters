                     <p>William B. Anderson's letter dated August 10, 1862 from Cincinnati and addressed to his wife Louisa 
                        is written in ink on both sides of a loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 
                        10.0 inches tall (20cm by 24.5cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced about 0.75cm apart. 
                        The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges are clean, suggesting that 
                        the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook.  It appears originally to have been folded once 
                        crosswise and three times lengthwise. At this writing, the ink appears dark brown and the paper off-white (cream). </p>

         <projectDesc>
            <p>The letter written by William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa on August 10 of 
               1862 is a fairly long letter with about 486 words; however is still much like 
               the other letters in our collection.  This particular letter, along with all 
               but two, was composed by Anderson while in Cincinnati, OH. This letter, like 
               many of his letters, speaks briefly about his work on the river, but mostly
               the letter consists of casual correspondence between Anderson and his wife.  
               Most of Anderson’s letters follow the same outline; a quick recap of his recent 
               work activities, the weather and river conditions as well as the status of his 
               river boat. He then moves on to ask how his wife and their children are, he 
               also asks about personal and financial issues back home. </p>
            
            <p>The fact that most of Anderson’s letters were composed from Cincinnati and dated 
               fairly regularly gives us a sense of his schedule and whereabouts along the Ohio
               River.  Within each letter Anderson tells his wife what cities he has just come
               from and where he is headed.  This schedule also helps us connect Anderson’s 
               business as a riverboat captain to well known Civil War events. By looking at the 
               date of each letter we are able to correlate his activity on the Ohio River with 
               the American Civil War.  In fact, this letter mentions Buffington Island.  
               Although this letter is dated almost a year before the battle at Buffington Island 
               (<hi rend="italics">Buffington Island</hi>), it still shows how Anderson’s life on 
               the Ohio River was directly related to the American Civil War.  </p>
            
            <p>Throughout the collection we also learn that being a riverboat captain is not
               Anderson’s only occupation.  This letter does not directly reference his business 
               back home but as with many of the letters Anderson tells his wife how to handle 
               financial business back home.  Specifically, in this letter, Anderson tells Louisa 
               that he has requested that John Russel, a local businessman often referred to in 
               Anderson’s letters (<hi rend="italics">The Bibliographical Review</hi>, 205), was 
               to pay his taxes.</p>
            
            <p>All of these letters provide a wonderful sense of what life in the Midwest was 
               like during the years of the Civil War and more importantly they convey the "common 
               man's view of great events"(Smith). Anderson’s letter written to his wife on 10 August 
               1862 along with the other letters included in the collection should also prove interesting 
               to business historians and students of letter writing in American culture (Hewitt)</p>

            <p>In general, this edition follows the Text Encoding Initiative's Guidelines
               for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, XML-compatible edition P4.

               To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
               supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
               the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
               &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
               the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
               image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
               by the Media Manager application.</p>

               •	Explain any revisions to the TEI DTD.
               •	Explain any special naming conventions used in your encoding (for example, the ID

            <note id="n4">4. "Parkersburg was originally named Newport when it was laid out in the late 1700s. 
               A section of the land in the town was laid out over land granted to Alexander Parker for his Revolutionary 
               War service. The title conflicts between Parker and the city planners of Newport were settled in 1809 in 
               favor of Alexander Parker's heirs. The town was renamed Parkersburg in 1810. It was chartered by the
               Virginia General Assembly in 1820. It was rechartered as a city in 1860. The town was the terminus of
               the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike and the Northwestern Turnpike. In 1857 the Baltimore and Ohio
               Railroad built a branch line to the town. The town was important as a transportation and medical center 
               during the American Civil War. It then became a transportation hub in the gas and oil boom following that 
               war. It is now the home of the Bureau of the Public Debt."<bibl>
