                     <p>
                        William B. Anderson's letter dated August 16, 1862 from Cincinnati and
                        addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
                        loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                        tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                        (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                        All four edges of the letter, 
                      are clean, suggesting that the sheet was bought as a package of looseleaf. 
                        It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
                        At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                        by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                        corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                        (0.6 cm) from the left edge.

            <p> This letter, written by William B. Anderson to his wife Louisa, is part of a collecton from the Rare Books and 
               Manuscripts Department at the Ohio State University Main Library in Columbus, Ohio. Most of the William B. Anderson letters describe
               his daily tasks as a riverboat captain during the Civil War through basic correspondance with his wife. This particular letter, written on August 16, 1862,
               is a heartfelt note that reveals emotion and grief about
            Anderson's occupation as a riverboat captain.  Anderson's job was to board soldiers and take them away to where they were needed. He wrote
               to his wife about how saddened he is to take these men away from their families. The William B. Anderson letters
            are useful in constructing a personal view of life during the Civil War. Though textbooks and objective sources about the Civil War are informative
            and helpful, the William B. Anderson Letters provide a personal touch for the reader and present a sentiment that may not be
               present in objective sources. </p>
            <p>This letter is significant because
            it allows the reader to relate to Anderson and understand his hardships and feelings. In David Levys's Scrolling Forward, Levy discusses how letters
            are a gateway to one's feelings. A letter "addresses a highly personal subject; and in its hand-produced marks it expresses some of the 
            drama and pathos of the situation in which it is embedded" (Levy, 80&ndash;81). While examining the William B. Anderson letters, it is important for the reader to search the images provided
            and see these hand-produced marks that reveal a certain degree of vulnerability in the author. Though electronic editions can at times lose the personal touch of the letters, the reader is
            encouraged to search the images and visit the Rare Books and Manuscripts Department at the Ohio State University Main Library. </p>

            <p>Title: Letter from William B. Anderson to his wife, Louisa, 16 August 1862.
               Editor: Martha Fissel
                           </p>
            <p> Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental information allowing for semi-modernized, corrected, regularized, or expanded views included as the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg" attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.
               
               Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake of clarity and encoded with the TEI  element.
                  
                  The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.
                  
                  The critical apparatus used in particular views of the letters is explained at the bottom of each view.

            <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year, month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).

To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the  Page Break Element. The values of the MMID attribute in page break elements and the file IDs in the URL attribute  that link to, or embed, image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated by the Media Manager application.

            <p>In this letter, Anderson writes to his wife about his daily tasks and his hardships while being a riverboat captain.
            He reports that a shaft has broken on the boat, and hopes the new part will arrive soon. Anderson continues his letter and describes how he feels about boarding soldiers on his riverboat. 
            His emotions of grief and sadness overrun the second half of his letter, and he explains that he feels terrible watching families be torn apart. Anderson closes with warm wishes to his family
               and that he hopes to hear from them soon.</p>
