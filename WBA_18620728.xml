                     William B. Anderson's letter dated July 28, 1862 and
                     addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on two sides of a 
                     loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                     tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                     (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. On the second page 
                     William writes part of the letter on the left side because he ran out of room.
                     The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                     are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                     It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise.
                     On the second page, William writes on the side of the page because maybe he was
                     running out of room.
                     At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                     by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                     corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                     (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
                     closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
                     mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."

            <p>Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental
               information allowing for semi-modernized, corrected, regularized, or expanded views included as 
               the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable
               cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
               have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
               versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
               attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
            <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
               or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake 
               of clarity and encoded with the TEI &lt;supplied&gt; element.</p>
            <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation
               and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and 
               signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.</p>

            <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters
            are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
            convention: WBA_18620728.xml. Dates of composition were determined from
            various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
            evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year,
            month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
            appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style
            sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore
            and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).</p>
         <p>In general, this edition follows the Text Encoding Initiative's Guidelines

            To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition

            the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
            &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
            the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
            image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated

            <p>William B. Anderson's letter was addressed to his wife, Louisa, telling her that he was 
               glad to hear about her welfare and also to hear about the kids doing well. 
               William says in the letter that the war is far from over even though some people might think otherwise. 
               William also ask Louisa to write him back when she gets a chance because from the time he gets 
               back he'll have another letter waiting.</p>

               the letter on the second page is written on the side of the letter for about 3-4 sentences and 
               this made the William B. Anderson's letter even harder to read.
