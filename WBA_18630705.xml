                     <p>This three page long letter written by W.B. Anderson on July fifth 1863 is written with a 
                        brown/black ink on a loose piece of off-white, blue lined paper, approximately 7.5inches 
                        wide by 10 inches long. The letter in its current state is appears as if it was folded twice
                        vertically and once horizontally. The document was written front and back on 2 sheets of 
                        paper for a total of 3 pages in length. The page also contains a printer’s mark in the upper
                        right hand corner of the page which is now indistinguishable. This printer’s mark closely 
                        resembles other printers marks found on several of Anderson’s letters including the letter 
                        of 27 June 1862 and the letter of 1 July 1863. On these other letters you can more clearly 
                        read "MT HOLLY PAPER CO."

            <p>
               The initiative we have taken to make these letters more available to scholars and interested parties isn’t intended
               simply to present the original document transcribed here, but rather to create a whole 
               new textual document. This document will allow people access to something that they most likely 
               would not be able to reference otherwise. In addition to this it will address one of very important points
               brought up by Kevin Kiernan in "Electronic Textual Editing: Digital Facsimiles in Editing." Kiernan points 
               out the importance of merging the digital image of the original text with a method of incorporating hardware 
               that allows the study of that text to be done with greater ease by scholars.
            </p>
            
            <p>In this letter, as in many of Anderson’s letters to his wife, we see him making a point to keep in touch with his
               family. He goes into great details about his day as well as giving us as readers an insight into something more 
               important that is happening in the world around Anderson, the civil war. In this particular letter Anderson goes 
               into detail about the war, in particular the mention of the burning of Lebanon Ohio. </p>
            
            <p>Since this letter gives us insight into a civil war occurrence from the perspective of someone other 
               than a solder we can see how it can be important to many scholars. By looking into Andersons life during the war scholars can take another view of the war to 
               better help us understand the history of our nation. This makes this document invaluable to those studying 
               the history of America, the history of the civil war, or even the history of the Ohio River.</p>

            <p>H. Lewis Ulman has best described our editorial methods in his example work with the  Anderson letters when he said the:
        "Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental information allowing for semi-modernized, 
               corrected, regularized, or expanded views included as the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, 
               recoverable cancellations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks have all been transcribed or tagged 
               as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg" 
               attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.” There truely is no better way to describe the methods that we have used here.

            <p>In this letter W.B. Anderson gives us a description of the difficulty he has unloading
               a shipment because of the civil war. More importantly though Anderson gives us an insight
               in this letter to the burning of Lebanon during the civil war, from the stand point of
               a civilian in public enterprise during this time. Some of the impact that we are given 
               insight to includes the organization of local troops and how it is holding back Anderson 
               and his shipment.</p>

               <lb/>I take my pen to let you know
               <lb/> that I am well.  we  arrived here on Friday
               <lb/>Morning and had to go over to the other side
               <lb/>of the river and about a mile up <name type="place" reg="Licking, River, KY">Licking</name>
               <lb/>to put out our Metal and had a terrible 
               <lb/>time getting unloaded the Irish in this town
               <lb/>are all on a rioting spree and wont work
               <lb/>nor let any body else work we made a
               <lb/>Contract with a party to put our load off
               <lb/>for 15 <abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> per ton and when we got to the
               <lb/>place to unload refused to work and then
               <lb/>all our Deck hands but 2 quit and would
               <lb/>not work so we sent over to <name type="place" reg="Cincinnati, OH">Cin</name>. for more
               <lb/>men and the Irish would not let them
               <lb/>cross on the ferry Boat so we had a good time
               <lb/>to get our load out but finally succeeded
               <lb/>and got back out of <name type="place" reg="Licking River, KY">Licking</name> and to the
               <lb/>Wharf here about 10 Oclock at night and

               <lb/>have a load we have now on and insight
               <lb/>half enough.  but the devil has broke loose
               <lb/>over in <name type="place">Kentucky</name> again last night the <name>Mayor</name>
               <lb/>Received a dispatch to send all the Forces

               <lb/>and the city was all one uproar last
