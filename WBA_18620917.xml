                     <p>   This letter in written on a single thin piece of blue-lined paper as the writing on the opposite side shows through. 
                        The singular, vertical jagged edge on the left side of the paper suggests that the paper was 
                        torn from a notebook or journal. The paper is approximately 8 x 9.75 inches in dimension. 
                        Anderson wrote the letter in brown ink  and folded the letter three times( once crosswise and
                        twice length-wise) to create 
                       six equally-sized sections so that the letter could fit into one 
                     of his standard envelopes. On the bottom of the first page, several words are smudged perhaps as a result of
                     moisture on the captain's hand from the summer heat or from a rapid writing pace that did not allow the ink to dry sufficiently.</p>

            <p > 
               This letter, written on June 17, 1862, shows a very personal reflection of the 
               effects of the Civil War. In this letter written from Cincinnati, from where 
               the great majority
               of Anderson's letters were sent,  Anderson focuses primarily on the uncertainities, 
               vicissitudes, and suffering faced by civilians and soldiers alike in wartime.
               Notably, this letter is the longest in this collection at a length of approximately 
               650 words. The length of the letter indicates that Anderson had many emotions with which 
               he was wrestling as a result of the war. Anderson's previous letter in this collection
               written on September 1, 1862, was relatively short and mentions his having recovered
               from a recent illness and touches on an economic matter or two. This letter, written only a couple 
               weeks later, begins rather neutrally with details about Anderson's work during the war. 
               From these recounts, 
               Anderson's thoughts quickly drift to his recent outlook on the war,
               "I have lost all horrors that I used to entertain about war [sic]
               I would as soon go to war as not if I were stout and had no family." 
               The captain writes that he would go to war in defense of the Union 
               if he had no familial ties to hold him back. He also touches briefly on the economic 
               devastation the Civil War inevitably
               will bring to the Union (and presumably the South).</p>
               
              <p> Anderson then elaborates on his food cravings and the rarity of some of the most
                 common food products. Anderson's longing for the simpler things in life like 'Butter [sic]' show
                 how deeply the war can infiltrate one's everyday life. The portion of the letter
                 devoted to food reinforces the homesick air found throughout the letter. </p>
               
               <p>Anderson then transitions in an economic matter, asking his wife to pay a visit 
                  to John Russell (probably a local merchant) requesting payment of the money owed 
                  to the
               Andersons. The captain expresses concern that the family may not receive their money
                  if his wife does not convey a sense of urgency to Mr. Russell. </p>
               
               <p>In closing, Anderson writes of his children and again of food. It appears 
                  that Anderson makes a strong association between his favorite foods and home. </p>
               
               <p>Both the length of the letter and the emotive language suggest that Anderson was
                  reaching a more trying point in his time as a riverboat captain. His committment to serving in the war
               took away his more familiar comforts both large, like his family, and small like his 
                  favorite foods. </p>

            <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters 
               are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following 
               naming convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from 
               various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal 
               evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year, 
               month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
               appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style sheet documents 
               are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore and a descriptive 
               phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).  </p>

                  attribute to the &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; 
                  elements and the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that 
                  link to, or embed, image, audio, and video files contained in the

            <p TEIform="p">In this letter, Anderson shows a bit of emotion as he recounts his 
               encounters with the war thus far. Anderson writes of the
               impoverished life he and his fellow shipmates live and becomes nostalgic
               over the simpler pleasures in life like Butter [sic] and Beef [sic]. 
            Anderson asks his wife to pay a vist to John Russell in order to collect 
               the money that Russell owes Anderson; Anderson fears that Russell
             will be slow to repay if his wife does not express a strong sense of need. 
               Anderson closes the letter optimistically speaking of great times to 
            come with his wife and children once he returns home. </p>
