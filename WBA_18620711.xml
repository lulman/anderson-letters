                     William B. Anderson's letter dated July 11, 1862 from Cincinnati and
                     addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on both sides of a 
                     loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 12.5 inches 
                     tall (20 x 32 cm). The paper is not ruled as are others in this collection.  
                     The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                     are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                     It appears originally to have been folded twice crosswise and not lengthwise, leaving
                     a 5 inch middle section without foldes. This may or may not illustrate the size of the envelope. 
                     At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                     by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                     corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                     (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
                     closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
                     mark on a letter dated July 18, 1863, which reads "OWEN &amp; HURLBUT SO. LEE MASS" 
                     (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
                     the RBML.

         <projectDesc>
            <p>William B. Anderson’s letter written on 11 July 1862 to his wife, Mary Louisa shares many elements
               with those letters in the collection of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State 
               University. The letters offer readers insight into the life world of the letter writer and 
               recipient. It is significant that W. B. Anderson is not a well-know historical figure and that 
               he was not public or remarkable in his time. Thus, this collection is rich with historical 
               information. The letters reveal details surrounding everyday 
               life on the Ohio River circa 1862 – 1864 (Hewitt). Moreover, with close attention to the collection we can see the use of 
               historical conventions of correspondence, the effects of the Civil War on families and the use of 
               letters as communication between family members separated for long periods. </p>
            
            <p>
               
               Though they were not written by a ‘remarkable’ figure, the letters are unique in that they defy 
               strict characterization as familial letters or as business letters. Rather, they are familial in 
               that they contain (often one-sided), personal dialogue between family members and they are relevant 
               to the family’s business prospects in that Anderson communicates with Mary Louisa about the 
               investments for which she is responsible in his absence (Hewitt). The letter of 11 July 1862 is 
               also distinctive within this unique collection. Of special interest is the content that is 
               revelatory of rules of letter writing, the familial and business inquiries, and what the letter 
               explains about the riverboat industry. Anderson’s writing style shows that he is educated in that 
               he attempts to follow letter etiquette of the time (Hewitt). He apologizes and asks his wife to 
               “excuse bad writing” presumably because he is rushed and is apologetic that he cannot write in 
               proper form. A unique feature of this letter is found in the multiple closings and signatures. 
               Each time he signs off, he follows similar rules. Although obviously rushed, he is sure to sign 
               his name after each addition. Moreover, it seems he is evaluating his wife’s letter writing and 
               seems to suggest that she is following conventions inadequately. He imagines her days as much 
               more conducive to proper letter writing than are his, and seems to see her as somewhat of an 
               inadequate letter writer. It is interesting to note that he sends her envelops for her letters. 
               Why this is so may offer insight to federal postal operations (Hewitt). </p>
            
            <p>Again, the letters on a whole include both familial and business issues and the letter of 
               11 July 1862 is no exception. Anderson inquires about two of the children (they had a total of five)
               and asks about the maid, giving insight into the household economy. He also asks his wife about 
               the prospects of Corn Plater[?] &amp; Co. which is presumably one of the companies with which 
               Mary Louisa does business. Anderson explains a bit about his work at hand on the riverboat. 
               His success and travels are dependent on the  “the prospect of water” and on the speed with 
               which he can transport goods. He tells her that,  “our prospects are poor” but that if his boat 
               is able to beat the Fanny McBurnie[?] to the dock at Murraysville, they will be benefited 
               materially. <figure rend="embedAud">

                  </figDesc>
               </figure>Thus, this letter shows that speed was indeed a dynamic factor of success in the 
               riverboat trade (Hewitt).  </p>
               
               
            <p>The archival life of this collection as a whole, along with the letter of 11 July 1862, 
               continues. Although the letters cannot be viewed in physical form unless one travels to 
               The Ohio State University, with the availability of the letters online they will be of interest to postal 
               historians, business historians and to scholars interested in nineteenth century 
               penmanship and linguistic conventions. </p>

               cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
               have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
               versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
               attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
            <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
               or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake 
               of clarity and encoded with the TEI &lt;supplied&gt; element.</p>
            <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation
               and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and 
               signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.</p>
            <p>The critical apparatus used in particular views of the letters is explained at the bottom of each view.</p>

            <p>At the time of publication (6 June 2006), the XML and XSL files related to this
               edition were stored in an XML publishing system operated by Humanities
               Information Systems (HIS), College of Humanities, The Ohio State University. For

            <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters
               are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
               convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from
               various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
               evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year,
               month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
               appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style
               sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore
               and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).</p>
            <p>In general, this edition follows the Text Encoding Initiative's Guidelines
               for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, XML-compatible edition P4.
               For more information about TEI P4, see <xref url="http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/">http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/</xref>.
               To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
               supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
               the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
               &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
               the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
               image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
               by the Media Manager application.</p>

            author tells his wife to "be sure to write as before" and that he has "enclosed an envelope in
            yesterday's letter. The day before (Friday) July 11, 1962 would have been a Thursday, whereas the 
            day before (Monday) July 11, 1964 would have been a Sunday. Assuming the author literally enclosed and mailed
            a letter containing an envelope, the date must be 1962 as he could not have sent mail out on Sunday.

               he may be naming the Fanny McBurnie. If so, he has misspelled the name by replacing 
               the ‘ie’ with a ‘y’, writing M. Burny. I found no record of a boat that went by such 
               a spelling. However, the Fanny McBurnie seems to have existed according to

               a boatyard there in 1838, after moving from Steubenville, Ohio. Steubenville, OH 
               and Murraysville, WV are located along the Ohio River. Murraysville is located 
               approximately halfway between Cincinatti, OH (where the author is located whilst 
               writing this letter) and Pittsburgh, PA (the author’s hometown) if one follows the distance
               of the Ohio River. W. B. Anderson had 
               Glide No. 2 built in Murraysville in 1862 after the government seized and bought 
               Glide No. 1. He used Glide No. 2 to carry supplies from Cincinnati to Nashville, 
               Tennessee, until the government took charge of, and then bought the boat.<bibl><title level="m"> History
