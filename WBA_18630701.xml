                        William B. Anderson's letter dated July 1, 1863 from Cincinnati and
                        addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
                        loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                        tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                        (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                        The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                        are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                        It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
                        At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                        by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                        corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                        (0.6 cm) from the left edge. It reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO" 
                        (see illustration).

         <projectDesc>
            <p>This particular letter from William B. Anderson to his wife, Mary Louisa, was written in Cincinnati
               in the summer (July 1) of 1863.  It deals with the typical issues that are included in many of the
               Anderson letters from the summer (1862-64).  Issues of maintaining the family, business, and financial
               prosperity are dealt with in this particular letter to Mary Louisa.  The issue of managing these affairs
               from a long distance is one which is important when trying to understand the Anderson Letters, as it
               pertains to the life of a riverboat captain and his family.  William Anderson had to attend to his family
               affairs through letters that were often written under rushed, shaky circumstances.</p>
            
            <p>This letter from July 1, 1863 is a very good indication of the commitment William Anderson had to
               his wife Louisa and their family.  While knee deep in the busy lifestyle of a riverboat captain on the Ohio
               River – which was thriving with commerce and was a critical waterway during this time period of the
               Civil War – William Anderson underwent the hardships one would experience in such
               circumstances.</p>
               
               <p>We see that William Anderson was shipping Government freight at this time, which includes
                  potatoes, horse wagons, ambulances, and horses.  The fact that Anderson was shipping ambulances
                  and horses and horse wagons implicates the importance of the cargo that he is shipping, thus  
                  implicating the importance of his job as the riverboat captain.  Anderson writes about the hard
                  work which is made harder in the summer heat.  His hard work and the implications of that work
                  points to the magnanimous importance of riverboats, and most relevant in the case of the Anderson
                  Letters, it points the importance of the Ohio River as a critical waterway for commerce and for
                  shipping cargo that was relevant in terms of the Civil War.</p>
               
               <p>William Anderson’s emphasis on financial issues and family issues are dominant in this letter, from
                  July 1, 1863.  The duality of lifestyles as a family man and a riverboat captain indicate William 
                  Anderson’s commitment to his tasks in life.  At the same token, we can see the importance of Anderson’s
                  wife, Mary Louisa, upholding the family back in Pittsburgh by taking care of the children and some
                  of the financial affairs.  Specifically, William Anderson tells Mary Louisa she can get sugar from places
                  in either Pittsburgh or Allegheny, and that he will send her money or she can get some from John Russell.</p>
               
               <p>Anderson exclaims his pleasure in hearing from his wife.  He tells her to kiss the little ones for him,
                  which is a statement that is seen in multiple letters from William Anderson to Mary Louisa.  He also
                  states that he is busy all the time or he would write more.  This letter indicates that the summer time is
                  very busy for riverboats.  Again, the importance of the riverboats, and the Ohio River, are seen in this
                  letter, but at the same time the importance of family for William Anderson shows up throughout this
                  particular letter and the collection of Anderson Letters as a whole.  </p>
            
                  <p>It is important that through editing
                  these editions of of the Anderson letters we maintain a user friendly base for our electronic editions.
                  Kevin Kiernan states in an article titled, "Electronic Textual Editing: Digital Facsimiles in Editing",
                  that "The apparatus, a Help function always a click away, should be comprehensive, incorporating such 
                  concepts as contents, preface, acknowledgments,  introduction, footnotes, and endnotes (whether explanatory
                  or textual), glossary, appendices, index, and bibliography."  The concept of creating an informative, user
                  friendly edition of the Anderson letters, while maintaining the integrity of the letters, is an important
                  aspect which we (as a class) have tried to incorporate into these letters.</p>

            <p>Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental

               the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations, recoverable
               cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
               have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
               versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
               attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.</p>
            <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and interlinear 
               or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake

            <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters
               are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
               convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from
               various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
               evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year,
               month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
               appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style
               sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore
               and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).</p>
            <p>In general, this edition follows the Text Encoding Initiative's Guidelines
               for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, XML-compatible edition P4.
               For more information about TEI P4, see <xref url="http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/">http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/</xref>.
               To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
               supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
               the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
               &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
               the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
               image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
               by the Media Manager application.</p>

               In this letter, from July 1, 1863, William B. Anderson writes to his wife, Mary Louisa, from
               Cincinnati.  Anderson tells his wife about the Government cargo he is shipping, and the hard
               work that goes along with handling the cargo in the summer heat.  Anderson also gives Mary Louisa
               advice pertaining to family and financial affairs back home in Pittsburgh.  He ends the letter 
               as he does most, with affection for his wife and telling her to kiss "the little ones" for him.
