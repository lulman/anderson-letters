                     William B. Anderson's letter dated June 27, 1862 from Pittsburgh and
                     addressed to his wife Louisa is written in ink on one side of a 
                     loose sheet of paper measuring approximately 7.5 inches wide by 9.0 inches 
                     tall (19 x 23 cm) and ruled with horizontal blue lines spaced .33 inches 
                     (0.8 cm) apart, except for a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) unruled top margin. 
                     The left edge of the sheet is slightly ragged, while the other three edges 
                     are clean, suggesting that the sheet was torn from a notepad or bound notebook. 
                     It appears originally to have been folded once crosswise and twice lengthwise. 
                     At this writing, the ink appears brown and the paper off-white (cream). A .5-inch
                     by .5-inch (1.3 x 1.3 cm) embossed printer's mark appears in the upper lefthand 
                     corner of the sheet, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the top edge and .25 inches 
                     (0.6 cm) from the left edge. Although the mark is indistinct, its shape 
                     closely matches that of a distinct, similarly sized and positioned printer's 
                     mark on a letter dated July 1, 1863, which reads "MT HOLLY PAPER CO." 
                     (see illustrations). Texture? Stiffness? Watermarks? I will have to visit 
                     the RBML.

               In some ways, William B. Anderson's short letter of 27 June 1862 to his wife, Mary Louisa, 
               typifies the twenty-one letters from William to Louisa that survive in the collection of the 
               Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. It addresses three of the 
               four broad topics about which he repeatedly writes to his wife during the summers of 1862, 1863, 
               and 1864: managing domestic affairs and sustaining familial bonds when family members are 
               separated for long periods by great distances; the rhetoric and logistics of mid-nineteenth-century 
               correspondence; and the economic, logistical, and physical challenges of the riverboat business, 
               especially on a waterway as critical as the Ohio River in the midst of the American Civil War 
               (in other letters, Anderson also reflects more broadly on the uncertainties, vicissitudes, and 
               suffering faced by civilians and soldiers alike in wartime).</p>
            <p>However, this letter is also unique. All but two of the letters were written from Cincinnati, 
               a thriving center of commerce on the Ohio River approximately halfway between its source at 
               the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and its confluence 
               with the Mississippi River a mile or so south of Cairo, Illinois. The remaining letter in the collection 
               was written from St. Louis, Missouri&mdash;though Anderson mentions writing from Louisville, Kentucky and 
               Nashville, Tennessee as well. This letter was written from Pittsburgh, William and Louisa's home town. 
               Presumably, he had been visiting his family and had expected to leave Pittsburgh by the Friday in late 
               June when he wrote the letter; he writes to inform his wife of a delay.</p>
            <p>As the collection in general reveals, delays were common, caused variously by negotiations over freight, 
               water levels on the river, mechanical difficulties, and various military complications. 
               Arrangements regarding freight seem to have kept Anderson in Pittsburgh overnight on June 27. 
               He wants to secure a full load before leaving Pittsburgh because he "cannot depend upon getting 
               any freight below here." He takes the opportunity to ask Louisa to send down "the Can of milk and 2 
               jars of lard and my clothes and overcoat." The definite article stands out: <hi rend="italics">the</hi> 
               Can of milk. 
               One wonders whether, in his habitual haste (on which he often blames poor spelling and handwriting), 
               he has simply rushed off and forgotten these items, and Louisa has sent him a note asking what she 
               should do with them. In any case, in his haste to send her instructions, he crosses out the next 
               two lines of his letter and recomposes them. Characteristically, the life of a riverboat captain 
               seems frenetic.</p>
            <p>It is also worth noting that he arranges to convey a note to his wife via "some one on the Shore at 
               Shousetown." While the Andersons clearly handled much of their correspondence through the U.S. 
               mail (he mentions post offices several times, and the collection includes one stamped envelope), 
               they often convey both messages and goods through intermediaries traveling by rail or river.</p>
            <p>Anderson's closing request constitutes something of a refrain in the letters. He asks Louisa to call 
               on a Mr. Russell (probably John Russell, a local merchant) in order to collect money owed him, 
               noting that he must meet his obligations on the crew's upcoming payday. Aside from suggesting that 
               riverboat captains had to watch their cash flow carefully, this request reminds us that Louisa played 
               a key role not only in caring for the Anderson household, including their four children (a fifth would 
               be born in 1865), but also in tending to their business interests. Though we have only William 
               Anderson's side of the correspondence, the letters reveal many details of Louisa's everyday life as well.</p>
            <p>It is Louisa, presumably, whom we have to thank for initially preserving the letters, probably for 
               the very common, personal reasons to which David Levy alludes in <title level="m">Scrolling Forward: Making Sense of 
               Documents in the Digital Age</title>: "In the privacy of our own homes we are likely to hold on to any number 
               of treasures: cards, letters, and notes written long ago, photographs, scrapbooks filled with mementoes 
               from an earlier era. We can't throw them out, even if we can't say why. We may look at them rarely or 
               not at all, yet still it is somehow comforting to know they are there. It's as if something of 
               importance is embedded in their very substance. This has less to do with their information content 
               per se than with the emotions they evoke and the personal relationships they signify and embody" (96–97). 
               The Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University purchased the letters in part 
               because they fit into a larger goal of acquiring materials that reveal the "common man's view of great 
               events," and war letters are one focus of that larger effort (Smith). The collection as a whole, and 
               the letter of 27 June 1862 more specifically, should also prove interesting to business historians and 
               students of letter writing in American culture (Hewitt). The passing of time has made the everyday 
               information in the letters newly valuable, though the letters also retain the power Levy speaks of to 
               evoke the emotional fabric of everyday life, especially when it becomes frayed in the course of great 
               events.</p>

               or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors for the sake 
               of clarity and encoded with the TEI &lt;supplied&gt; element.</p>
            <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including salutation
               and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and 
               signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.</p>
            <p>The critical apparatus used in particular views of the letters is explained at the bottom of each view.</p>

            <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters
               are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
               convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from
               various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
               evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year,
               month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
               appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style
               sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore
               and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).</p>
            <p>In general, this edition follows the Text Encoding Initiative's Guidelines
               for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, XML-compatible edition P4.
               For more information about TEI P4, see <xref url="http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/">http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/</xref>.
               To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
               supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
               the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
               &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
               the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
               image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
               by the Media Manager application.</p>

            <p>Anderson tells his wife that his boat's departure has been delayed by a day 
               and asks her to send some food and clothes to him at the dock. He also expresses 
               anxiety about whether his trip will be profitable and asks his wife to request 
               some money from [John?] Russell to help cover an upcoming payday for his crew.</p>
