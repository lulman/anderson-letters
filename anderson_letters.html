            </div>
            	                 
         </p>
         	                 
         
         <p> In some ways, William B. Anderson's short letter of 27 June 1862 to his wife, Mary
            Louisa, typifies the twenty-one letters from William to Louisa that survive in the
            collection of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University.
            It addresses three of the four broad topics about which he repeatedly writes to his
            wife during the summers of 1862, 1863, and 1864: managing domestic affairs and
            sustaining familial bonds when family members are separated for long periods by
            great distances; the rhetoric and logistics of mid-nineteenth-century
            correspondence; and the economic, logistical, and physical challenges of the
            riverboat business, especially on a waterway as critical as the Ohio River in the
            midst of the American Civil War (in other letters, Anderson also reflects more
            broadly on the uncertainties, vicissitudes, and suffering faced by civilians and
            soldiers alike in wartime).
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>However, this letter is also unique. All but two of the letters were written from
            Cincinnati, 
            	                   a thriving center of commerce on the Ohio River approximately
            halfway between its source at 
            	                   the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh,
            Pennsylvania and its confluence 
            	                   with the Mississippi River a mile or so south of Cairo, Illinois.
            The remaining letter in the collection 
            	                   was written from St. Louis, Missouri—though Anderson mentions
            writing from Louisville, Kentucky and 
            	                   Nashville, Tennessee as well. This letter was written from Pittsburgh,
            William and Louisa's home town. 
            	                   Presumably, he had been visiting his family and had expected to
            leave Pittsburgh by the Friday in late 
            	                   June when he wrote the letter; he writes to inform his wife of
            a delay.
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>As the collection in general reveals, delays were common, caused variously by negotiations
            over freight, 
            	                   water levels on the river, mechanical difficulties, and various
            military complications. 
            	                   Arrangements regarding freight seem to have kept Anderson in Pittsburgh
            overnight on June 27. 
            	                   He wants to secure a full load before leaving Pittsburgh because
            he "cannot depend upon getting 
            	                   any freight below here." He takes the opportunity to ask Louisa
            to send down "the Can of milk and 2 
            	                   jars of lard and my clothes and overcoat." The definite article
            stands out: the 
            	                   Can of milk. 
            	                   One wonders whether, in his habitual haste (on which he often
            blames poor spelling and handwriting), 
            	                   he has simply rushed off and forgotten these items, and Louisa
            has sent him a note asking what she 
            	                   should do with them. In any case, in his haste to send her instructions,
            he crosses out the next 
            	                   two lines of his letter and recomposes them. Characteristically,
            the life of a riverboat captain 
            	                   seems frenetic.
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>It is also worth noting that he arranges to convey a note to his wife via "some one
            on the Shore at 
            	                   Shousetown." While the Andersons clearly handled much of their
            correspondence through the U.S. 
            	                   mail (he mentions post offices several times, and the collection
            includes one stamped envelope), 
            	                   they often convey both messages and goods through intermediaries
            traveling by rail or river.
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>Anderson's closing request constitutes something of a refrain in the letters. He asks
            Louisa to call 
            	                   on a Mr. Russell (probably John Russell, a local merchant) in
            order to collect money owed him, 
            	                   noting that he must meet his obligations on the crew's upcoming
            payday. Aside from suggesting that 
            	                   riverboat captains had to watch their cash flow carefully, this
            request reminds us that Louisa played 
            	                   a key role not only in caring for the Anderson household, including
            their four children (a fifth would 
            	                   be born in 1865), but also in tending to their business interests.
            Though we have only William 
            	                   Anderson's side of the correspondence, the letters reveal many
            details of Louisa's everyday life as well.
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>It is Louisa, presumably, whom we have to thank for initially preserving the letters,
            probably for 
            	                   the very common, personal reasons to which David Levy alludes
            in <cite>Scrolling Forward: Making Sense of 
               	                     Documents in the Digital Age</cite>: "In the privacy of our own homes we are likely to hold on to any number 
            	                   of treasures: cards, letters, and notes written long ago, photographs,
            scrapbooks filled with mementoes 
            	                   from an earlier era. We can't throw them out, even if we can't
            say why. We may look at them rarely or 
            	                   not at all, yet still it is somehow comforting to know they are
            there. It's as if something of 
            	                   importance is embedded in their very substance. This has less
            to do with their information content 
            	                   per se than with the emotions they evoke and the personal relationships
            they signify and embody" (96–97). 
            	                   The Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University
            purchased the letters in part 
            	                   because they fit into a larger goal of acquiring materials that
            reveal the "common man's view of great 
            	                   events," and war letters are one focus of that larger effort (Smith).
            The collection as a whole, and 
            	                   the letter of 27 June 1862 more specifically, should also prove
            interesting to business historians and 
            	                   students of letter writing in American culture (Hewitt). The passing
            of time has made the everyday 
            	                   information in the letters newly valuable, though the letters
            also retain the power Levy speaks of to 
            	                   evoke the emotional fabric of everyday life, especially when it
            becomes frayed in the course of great 
            	                   events.

         <hr>
         <p>
            
            <p>This edition belongs to a series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of
               previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books
               and Manuscripts Library (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions
               include "Selected Entries from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries,
               30 July 1862 to 31 December 1862"; "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia
               Peabody Hawthorne to her
               sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868; "Journal of a Tour to Europe,"
               
               by Samuel Sullivan Cox; and Louisa A. Doane's "Journal
               of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853)."
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
               on electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of
               English at The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an
               opportunity to explore issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our
               cultural archives spread from page to screen and from library shelves to networked
               databases. Electronic textual editing served as each class's context for examining
               what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts in one medium are
               represented in another medium, especially with regard to the interpretive work of
               reading. Electronic textual editions also provided a contact zone that helped
               students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can tell
               us
               about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
               explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
               the lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics,
               and preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
               that shape particular interpretations and presentations texts; and the mediation of
               electronic delivery systems.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
               need to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing
               or
               the various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced
               the selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor
               Ulman identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially
               broad interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for
               example, letters and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger
               historical contexts. Focusing on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one
               case, associated with other copies or later published versions also eliminated the
               need to compare multiple copies or states of the same work, perhaps held in other
               archives, an impractical task in the course of an academic term. Other practical
               matters also informed the choice of materials, including the possibility of scanning
               the source documents before the class so that students could work with both the
               original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed and encoded
               the source texts.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
               representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access
               to
               manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with
               a
               variety of tools for studying those texts.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a sine qua non, the Stephens edition also
               explores ways of telling four stories inextricably woven into our work: the lives
               and
               historical milieu evoked by the texts, the history of the physical documents, the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the texts, and
               the
               mediation of our electronic delivery system. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
               the editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
               consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the
               structure of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional
               repository, evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers.
               However, he did not undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or
               revision of the students' introductory essays and annotations.

         <hr>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
            at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
            quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was
            used at any stage of image
            preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
            produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur
            in
            Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
            provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.. 
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Transcription</strong>. Editing of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription: 
            abbreviations, recoverable cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underlining, additions
            above and below
            the line or in the margins, capitalization, line breaks, and page breaks 
            have all been transcribed and encoded as they appear in the original manuscripts.
            The
            representation of those features varies depending on the view of the letter. An explanation
            of 
            the presentation in each view of the letters can be read via the "About this View"
            link
            at the top of each view's page.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Markup and Annotation</strong>. XML encoding of the Anderson letters follows The
            Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <cite>P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</cite>,
            as customized for the project using the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process.
            This editorial introduction and the three "views" of the letters were generated from
            the main XML file
            using XSL transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were
            encoded in HTML separately.
            A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices" menu,
            and all source files
            (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and downloaded via the "Source Files" menu.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated lists
            of people, places, ships, 
            and organizations mentioned in the letters are encoded in the TEI header of the main
            XML
            document. Other explanatory annotations are linked directly from the text. Separate
            appendices provide 
            further information about the project (e.g., acknowledgements, editors' bios, and
            so on). 
            All these ancillary materials can be viewed via the menus at the top of each page.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Proofing</strong>. Students who created the original transcriptions proofread their own
            transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by NINES and preservation
            in The Ohio State University's 
            Knowledge Bank, the transcriptions and encoding were once again proofread by Professor
            Ulman.
            
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Peer Review</strong>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided peer-reviews for the editions, in response
            to
