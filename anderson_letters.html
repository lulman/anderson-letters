         <p>Salutation from letter of 27 June 1862
            	                   In some ways, William B. Anderson's short letter of 27 June 1862
            to his wife, Mary Louisa, 
            	                   typifies the twenty-one letters from William to Louisa that survive
            in the collection of the 
            	                   Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University.
            It addresses three of the 
            	                   four broad topics about which he repeatedly writes to his wife
            during the summers of 1862, 1863, 
            	                   and 1864: managing domestic affairs and sustaining familial bonds
            when family members are 
            	                   separated for long periods by great distances; the rhetoric and
            logistics of mid-nineteenth-century 
            	                   correspondence; and the economic, logistical, and physical challenges
            of the riverboat business, 
            	                   especially on a waterway as critical as the Ohio River in the
            midst of the American Civil War 
            	                   (in other letters, Anderson also reflects more broadly on the
            uncertainties, vicissitudes, and 
            	                   suffering faced by civilians and soldiers alike in wartime).
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>However, this letter is also unique. All but two of the letters were written from
            Cincinnati, 
            	                   a thriving center of commerce on the Ohio River approximately
            halfway between its source at 
            	                   the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh,
            Pennsylvania and its confluence 
            	                   with the Mississippi River a mile or so south of Cairo, Illinois.
            The remaining letter in the collection 
            	                   was written from St. Louis, Missouri—though Anderson mentions
            writing from Louisville, Kentucky and 
            	                   Nashville, Tennessee as well. This letter was written from Pittsburgh,
            William and Louisa's home town. 
            	                   Presumably, he had been visiting his family and had expected to
            leave Pittsburgh by the Friday in late 
            	                   June when he wrote the letter; he writes to inform his wife of
            a delay.
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>As the collection in general reveals, delays were common, caused variously by negotiations
            over freight, 
            	                   water levels on the river, mechanical difficulties, and various
            military complications. 
            	                   Arrangements regarding freight seem to have kept Anderson in Pittsburgh
            overnight on June 27. 
            	                   He wants to secure a full load before leaving Pittsburgh because
            he "cannot depend upon getting 
            	                   any freight below here." He takes the opportunity to ask Louisa
            to send down "the Can of milk and 2 
            	                   jars of lard and my clothes and overcoat." The definite article
            stands out: the 
            	                   Can of milk. 
            	                   One wonders whether, in his habitual haste (on which he often
            blames poor spelling and handwriting), 
            	                   he has simply rushed off and forgotten these items, and Louisa
            has sent him a note asking what she 
            	                   should do with them. In any case, in his haste to send her instructions,
            he crosses out the next 
            	                   two lines of his letter and recomposes them. Characteristically,
            the life of a riverboat captain 
            	                   seems frenetic.
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>It is also worth noting that he arranges to convey a note to his wife via "some one
            on the Shore at 
            	                   Shousetown." While the Andersons clearly handled much of their
            correspondence through the U.S. 
            	                   mail (he mentions post offices several times, and the collection
            includes one stamped envelope), 
            	                   they often convey both messages and goods through intermediaries
            traveling by rail or river.
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>Anderson's closing request constitutes something of a refrain in the letters. He asks
            Louisa to call 
            	                   on a Mr. Russell (probably John Russell, a local merchant) in
            order to collect money owed him, 
            	                   noting that he must meet his obligations on the crew's upcoming
            payday. Aside from suggesting that 
            	                   riverboat captains had to watch their cash flow carefully, this
            request reminds us that Louisa played 
            	                   a key role not only in caring for the Anderson household, including
            their four children (a fifth would 
            	                   be born in 1865), but also in tending to their business interests.
            Though we have only William 
            	                   Anderson's side of the correspondence, the letters reveal many
            details of Louisa's everyday life as well.
         </p>
         	                 
         <p>It is Louisa, presumably, whom we have to thank for initially preserving the letters,
            probably for 
            	                   the very common, personal reasons to which David Levy alludes
            in <cite>Scrolling Forward: Making Sense of 
               	                     Documents in the Digital Age</cite>: "In the privacy of our own homes we are likely to hold on to any number 
            	                   of treasures: cards, letters, and notes written long ago, photographs,
            scrapbooks filled with mementoes 
            	                   from an earlier era. We can't throw them out, even if we can't
            say why. We may look at them rarely or 
            	                   not at all, yet still it is somehow comforting to know they are
            there. It's as if something of 
            	                   importance is embedded in their very substance. This has less
            to do with their information content 
            	                   per se than with the emotions they evoke and the personal relationships
            they signify and embody" (96–97). 
            	                   The Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University
            purchased the letters in part 
            	                   because they fit into a larger goal of acquiring materials that
            reveal the "common man's view of great 
            	                   events," and war letters are one focus of that larger effort (Smith).
            The collection as a whole, and 
            	                   the letter of 27 June 1862 more specifically, should also prove
            interesting to business historians and 
            	                   students of letter writing in American culture (Hewitt). The passing
            of time has made the everyday 
            	                   information in the letters newly valuable, though the letters
            also retain the power Levy speaks of to 
            	                   evoke the emotional fabric of everyday life, especially when it
            becomes frayed in the course of great 
            	                   events.

         <h3 id="projectDescription">Project Description</h3>
         <p>
            
            <p>This edition represents a series of letters that William B. Anderson wrote to his
               wife, Louisa,
               at the time of  the Civil War. During the war, Anderson piloted steam ships along
               the Ohio River, carrying
               freight and passengers alike. At this time, letter writing was the most effective
               means of communication, and the
               only way to keep domestic affairs in order.
            </p>
            
            <p>The collection of letters penned by Anderson was purchased by the Ohio State Rare
               Books and Manuscripts library. They purchased the letters in an effort to increase
               their collection of wartime letters as well as documents that better illustrate the
               life-world of 
               the historical periods that the letters were written in. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>The reason for digitizing these documents is that the editors are trying to make these
               documents as easily accessible to as many people as possible. These letters may be
               of intest
               to historians interested in the Civil War, the Steamship Industry, or even postal
               historians. These
               potential readers were given the most careful consideration in designing the digital
               texts. The hope is
               that by making these annotated and edited documents available on the world wide web,
               that the documents will be "streamlined
               and tailored in the service of ever greater efficiency" (Levy 69). Hopefully, the
               rich media and annotations
               provided will help make these documents more easily understood while the technology
               itself makes them
               more widely available to interested audiences.
            </p>
            
         </p>
         <h3>Editorial Method</h3>
         
         <p>Encoding of the Anderson letters emphasizes diplomatic transcription, with supplemental
            information allowing for semi-modernized, corrected, regularized, or expanded views
            included as 
            the values of attributes associated with various elements. Accordingly, abbreviations,
            recoverable
            cancelations, punctuation, spelling, underscoring, capitalization, line breaks, and
            page breaks 
            have all been transcribed or tagged as they appear in the original manuscripts. Regularized
            versions of all names and referring strings have been encoded as the values of "reg"
            attributes. Standard format values for all dates have been encoded in "value" attributes.
         </p>
         
         <p>Corrections and emendations in Anderson's hand have been encoded as cancelations and
            interlinear 
            or marginal additions. In a few cases, omitted text has been supplied by the editors
            for the sake 
            of clarity and encoded with the TEI &lt;supplied&gt; element.
         </p>
         
         <p>The following structural elements of the letters are also encoded: opener (including
            salutation
            and dateline), body, lines, paragraphs, pages, and closers (including salutation and
            
            signature). Notes and postscripts are identified as such.
         </p>
         
         <p>The critical apparatus used in particular views of the letters is explained at the
            bottom of each view.
         </p>
         
         <p>The XML and XSL files related to this
            edition are all available in the KB.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The XML files that constitute this edition of the William B. Anderson letters
            are named according the letters' dates of composition, using the following naming
            convention: WBA_YYYYMMDD.xml. Dates of composition were determined from
            various sources of evidence: the datelines inscribed in the letters, internal
            evidence in the body of the letters, and perpetual calendars. If the year,
            month, or date on which a letter was written could not be determined, the 
            appropriate part of the filename is rendered with 0s. XSL style
            sheet documents are named with the prefix "WBA" followed by an underscore
            and a descriptive phrase (e.g., "WBA_diplomatic.xsl).
         </p>
         
         <p>To facilitate embedding or linking to image, audio, and video files, this edition
            supplements the Text Encoding Initiative's DTD by adding a URL attribute to 
            the &lt;xref&gt; element and an MMID (i.e., Media Manager ID) attribute to the 
            &lt;pb&gt; element. The values of the MMID attribute in &lt;pb&gt; elements and
            the file IDs in the URL attribute of &lt;xref&gt; elements that link to, or embed, 
            image, audio, and video files contained in the Media Manager are generated 
            by the Media Manager application.
