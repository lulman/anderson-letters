         <h2>The Distress of "The Human Family" During Wartime</h2>
         <hr>
         
         <div class="fl_img_right"><img src="./image_mydearwife.png" alt=" My Dear Wife "><br>Salutation from letter of 27 June 1862</div>
         
         <p> In some ways, William B. Anderson's short letter of 27 June 1862 to his wife, Mary
            Louisa, typifies the twenty letters from William to Louisa that survive in the
            collection of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University.
            It addresses three of the four broad topics about which he repeatedly writes to his
            wife during the summers of 1862, 1863, and 1864: managing domestic affairs and
            sustaining familial bonds when family members are separated for long periods by
            great distances; the rhetoric and logistics of mid-nineteenth-century
            correspondence; and the economic, logistical, and physical challenges of the
            riverboat business, especially on a waterway as critical as the Ohio River in the
            midst of the American Civil War. In several other letters, Anderson also reflects
            more broadly on the uncertainties, vicissitudes, and suffering faced by civilians
            and soldiers alike in wartime.</p>
         
         <p>However, this letter is in some ways unique. All but two of the letters were
            written from Cincinnati, a thriving center of commerce on the Ohio River
            approximately halfway between its source at the confluence of the Allegheny and
            Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and its confluence with the
            Mississippi River a mile or so south of Cairo, Illinois. One letter in the
            collection was written from St. Louis, Missouri. Anderson mentions writing from
            Louisville, Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee, but those letters are not preserved
            in this collection. The letter of 27 June 1862 was written from Pittsburgh, near
            William and Louisa's home in Shousetown, Pennsylvania. Presumably, he had been
            visiting his family and had expected to leave Pittsburgh by the Friday in late June
            when he wrote the letter; he writes to inform his wife of a delay.</p>
         
         <p>As the collection in general reveals, delays were common, caused variously by
            negotiations over freight, water levels on the river, mechanical difficulties, and
            various military complications. Arrangements regarding freight seem to have kept
            Anderson in Pittsburgh overnight on June 27. He wants to secure a full load before
            leaving Pittsburgh because he "cannot depend upon getting any freight below here."
            He takes the opportunity to ask Louisa to send down "the Can of milk and 2 jars of
            lard and my clothes and overcoat." Perhaps in his habitual haste (on which he often
            blames poor spelling and handwriting), he has simply rushed off and forgotten these
            items, and Louisa has sent him a note asking what she should do with them. In any
            case, in his haste to send her instructions, he crosses out the next two lines of
            his letter and recomposes them. The content and the form of the letters suggest that
            the life of a riverboat captain was frenetic.</p>
         
         <p>It is also worth noting that he arranges to convey a note to his wife via "some one
            on the Shore at Shousetown." While the Andersons clearly handled much of their
            correspondence through the U.S. mail (he mentions post offices several times, and
            the collection includes one stamped envelope), they often convey both messages and
            goods through intermediaries traveling by rail or river, adapting to the sometimes
            chaotic circumstances on the river.</p>
         
         <p>Anderson's closing request constitutes something of a refrain in the letters. He
            asks Louisa to call on a Mr. Russell (probably John Russell, a local merchant) in
            order to collect money owed him, noting that he must meet his obligations on the
            crew's upcoming payday. Aside from suggesting that riverboat captains had to watch
            their cash flow carefully, this request reminds us that Louisa played a key role not
            only in caring for the Anderson household, including their four children (a fifth
            would be born in 1865), but also in tending to their business interests. Though we
            have only William Anderson's side of the correspondence, the letters reveal many
            details of Louisa's everyday life as well.</p>
         
         <p>It is Louisa, presumably, whom we have to thank for initially preserving the
            letters, probably for the very common, personal reasons to which David Levy alludes
            in <cite>Scrolling Forward: Making Sense of Documents in the Digital
               Age</cite>: "In the privacy of our own homes we are likely to hold on to any
            number of treasures: cards, letters, and notes written long ago, photographs,
            scrapbooks filled with mementoes from an earlier era. We can't throw them out, even
            if we can't say why. We may look at them rarely or not at all, yet still it is
            somehow comforting to know they are there. It's as if something of importance is
            embedded in their very substance. This has less to do with their information content
            per se than with the emotions they evoke and the personal relationships they signify
            and embody" (96–97). The Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State
            University purchased the letters in part because they fit into a larger goal of
            acquiring materials that reveal the "common man's view of great events," and war
            letters are one focus of that larger effort (Smith). The collection as a whole, and
            the letter of 27 June 1862 more specifically, should also prove interesting to
            business historians and students of letter writing in American culture (Hewitt). The
            passing of time has made the everyday information in the letters newly valuable,
            though the letters also retain the power Levy speaks of to evoke the emotional
            fabric of everyday life, especially when it becomes frayed in the course of great
            events.</p>

         <p>This edition belongs to a series of collaboratively produced electronic editions of
            previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in the Rare Books
            and
            Manuscripts Library (RBMS) at The Ohio State University Libraries. Other editions
            include
            "Selected Entries from the Lucius Clark Smith Diaries, 30 July 1862 to 31 December
            1862";
            "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody Hawthorne to her sister
            Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868; "Journal of a Tour to Europe,"
            by
            Samuel Sullivan Cox; Louisa A. Doane's "Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853),"
            and
            "Selected Letters from the Ivan S. Gilbert Collection of Stephens Family Travel Letters
            and Ephemera."</p>
         
         
         <p>Each text was initially edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course
            on
            electronic textual editing offered by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English
            at
            The Ohio State University. The courses provided students with an opportunity to explore
            issues of textuality and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from
            page
            to screen and from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing
            served as each class's context for examining what happens—and envisioning what might
            happen—when artifacts in one medium are represented in another medium, especially
            with
            regard to the interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provided
            a
            contact zone that helped students reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital"
            artifacts can tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one
            another.</p>
         
         
         <p>While the students' work focused on providing reliable textual editions, they also
            explored four threads inextricably woven into the work of electronic textual editing:
            the
            lives and historical milieu evoked by the texts; the history, characteristics, and
            preservation of physical and digital texts; the editorial processes and decisions
            that
            shape particular interpretations and presentations of texts; and the mediation of
            electronic delivery systems.</p>
         
         
         <p>These conceptual focuses, along with the time constraints of academic terms and the
            need
            to train students who had, typically, no prior experience in textual editing or the
            various technologies employed in electronic textual editing, strongly influenced the
            selection of texts in this series. Working with curators in the RBMS, Professor Ulman
            identified previously unpublished manuscript materials that were of potentially broad
            interest and that reflected a curatorial focus of the RBMS collection—for example,
            letters
            and personal diaries that connect private lives with larger historical contexts. Focusing
            on unique manuscript materials not, in all but one case, associated with other copies
            or
            later published versions also eliminated the need to compare multiple copies or states
            of
            the same work, perhaps held in other archives, an impractical task in the course of
            an
            academic term. Other practical matters also informed the choice of materials, including
            the possibility of scanning the source documents before the class so that students
            could
            work with both the original documents and high-resolutions facsimiles as they transcribed
            and encoded the source texts.</p>
         
         
         <p>Thus, the editions in this series are documentary editions—interpretations and
            representations of single documents—designed to provide wider exposure and access
            to
            manuscript materials that might otherwise be overlooked, and to provide users with
            a
            variety of tools for studying those texts.</p>
         
         
         <p> Over the course of several years following the classes in which students worked on
            the
            editions, Professor Ulman revised the introductory materials to ensure stylistic
            consistency and proofed the transcription and encoding. He also redesigned the structure
            of the editions to meet the requirements of Ohio State's institutional repository,
            evolving accessibility standards, and feedback from peer reviewers. However, he did
            not
            undertake a complete retranscription of the source text or revision of the students'
            introductory essays and annotations.</p>

         <p> Most of the letters in the Anderson collection were written on one or two sides of
            a single sheet of lined, manilla-colored writing paper torn from a tablet, notebook,
            or larger sheet. Many bear a watermark in the upper left-hand corner. See individual

         <p><strong>Selection of the Source Text</strong>. This edition contains the
            twenty letters written by William B. Anderson to his wife, Louisa Anderson, taking
            a
            literal rather than figurative clue from what Anderson calls in one letter the
            "distres [<em style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:none;">sic</em>] that this war has brought on the human
            family." By contrast, the additional letter in the collection and the four receipts
            deal exclusively with Anderson's shipping business.</p>

         <h2>Editorial Method</h2>
         <hr>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Scanning</strong>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF images
            at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then converted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and full
            quality. All edges were overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was
            used at
            any stage of image preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the
            same
            scanner produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian
            Blur
            in Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
            provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.. </p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Transcription</strong>. Editing of the Anderson letters emphasizes
            diplomatic transcription: abbreviations, recoverable cancellations, punctuation, spelling,
            underlining, additions above and below the line or in the margins, capitalization,
            line
            breaks, and page breaks have all been transcribed and encoded as they appear in the
            original manuscripts, though the distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters
            in
            Anderson's hasty writing is often conjectural. The presentation of features such as
            line
            and paragraph breaks varies depending on the view of the letter. An explanation of
            the
            presentation in each view of the letters can be read via the "About this View" link
            at the
            top of each view's page.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>Markup and Annotation</strong>. XML encoding of the Anderson letters
            follows The Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) <cite>P5: Guidelines for
               Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</cite>, as customized for the project using
            the TEI's ODD ("One Document Does it All") process. This editorial introduction and
            the
            three "views" of the letters were generated from the main XML file using XSL
            transformations to produce HTML Web pages. Several of the appendices were encoded
            in HTML
            separately. A more detailed description of the markup can be found via the "Appendices"
            menu, and all source files (XML, XSL, CSS, ODD, RNC) can be viewed and downloaded
            via the
            "Source Files" menu.</p>
         
         
         <p>Introductory material (such as this editorial introduction) as well as annotated lists
            of
            people, places, ships, and organizations mentioned in the letters are encoded in the
            TEI
            header of the main XML document. Other explanatory annotations are linked directly
            from
            the text. Separate appendices provide further information about the project (e.g.,
            acknowledgements, editors' bios, and so on). All these ancillary materials can be
            viewed
            via the menus at the top of each page.</p>
         
         
         <p>
            <strong>Proofing</strong>. Students who created the original transcriptions
            proofread their own transcription and encoding. In preparation for peer review by
            NINES
            and preservation in The Ohio State University's Knowledge Bank, the transcriptions
            and
            encoding were once again proofread by Professor Ulman. </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Peer Review</strong>. Anonymous reviewers for NINES provided peer-reviews
            for the editions, in response to which they were revised and then reviewed by NINES
            editors before being listed in the NINES database. </p>
         
         <p>
            <strong>Production and Archival Location of Digital Assets</strong>. All of the
            files associated with this edition are accessed via, and archived in, The Ohio State
            University's institutional repository, the Knowledge Bank. </p>

         <h3 id="peopleMentioned">People Mentioned in Anderson's Letters</h3>
         <p>This list includes the principal persons mentioned in the letters.</p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, John L.</strong>
            (b. 1859 -  
            d. 1922-05-27). 
            Son of William B. Anderson and Mary Louisa Fischgens Anderson.
            He survived the typhoid in 1890 that killed three of his siblings. He never
            married 
            (Cushing 298; Danker, "RE: Request").
            </p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, Mary Louisa, née Fischgens</strong>
            (b. 1837-04-14, Pittsburgh, PA -  
            d. 1911-08-25, Pittsburgh, PA).
            Mary Louisa Fischgens and Capt. William B. Anderson were
            married September 15, 1853 in Cincinnati, Ohio. As the letters show, during the time
            that William was on the river, Louisa both cared for their five children and managed
            business transactions related to both their homestead and riverboat 
            (Cushing 298; Doherty).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, William B.</strong>
            (b. 1822-10-10, Washington County, PA -  
            d. 1897-11-15, Allegheny County, PA).
            Captain William B. Anderson was involved in lake and river
            commerce for over twenty-five years. He was both a boat builder and captain, and
            maintained a farm and homestead in Allegheny County, PA. Mary Louisa Fischgens and
            William B. Anderson were married September 15, 1853 in Cincinnati, Ohio and had four
            children at the time these letters were written 
            (Cushing 298; Weber).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Anderson, William Y.</strong>
            (b. 1855 -  
            d. 1890-11-23). 
            Son of William B. Anderson and Mary Louisa Fischgens Anderson.
            He Married Nancy C. McKinley and resided in Shousetown, Pa. He died of typhoid in
            180,
            leaving a widow and two children 
            (Cushing 298; Danker, "RE: Request").
            </p>
         <p><strong>Fischgens, Anna Mary, née Woolslayer</strong>
            (b. 1812-07-12, Pittsburgh, PA -  
            d. 1897-11-25, Pittsburgh, PA).
            Mary Louisa Anderson's mother, whom Anderson sometimes refers
            to in the letters as "the old lady," is living in Cincinnati, OH with her daughter
            Ella during the period covered by the letters 
            (Cushing 298; Konrad).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Fischgens, Ella Jane</strong>
            (b. 1851-09-21, New Jersey -  
            d. 1863-09-04, Cincinnati, OH).
            Anderson mentions Louisa Anderson's younger sister Ella in
            many of the letters. He last mentions her in his letter of 1 August 1863, a little
            more than a month before she died, but he does not mention that she has been
            ill 
            (ind A Grave; Danker, <cite>William B. Anderson Letters</cite>).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Hatch, George</strong>. George Hatch served as mayor of Cincinnati from
            1861-1863 
            (Miller 165).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Morgan, John Hunt</strong>
            (b. 1825-06-01, Huntsville, Alabama -  
            d. 1864-09-04, Greenville, Tennessee).
            In his letter of 5 July 1863, Anderson refers to the burning
            of Lebanon, KY during one of General Morgan's raids on Union forces 
            (Rosenburg).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Russel, John</strong>. John Russel was “a prominent merchant on Liberty Street,
            Pittsburgh, PA, for many years” 
            (<cite>Biographical Review</cite> 205).
            </p>
         <p><strong>Wright, Horatio Gouverneur</strong>
            (b. 1820-03-06, Clinton, Connecticut -  
            d. 1899-07-02, Washington, D.C.).
            General Wright commanded the Division of Ohio from August 1862
            to March 1863 
            (American National

         <h3 id="organizationsMentioned">Organizations Mentioned in Anderson's Letters</h3>
         <p><strong>Adams Express Company</strong>:

            Ferry service across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, OH to Covington, KY.</p>
         <p><strong>Little Miami Railroad</strong>:
            The Little Miami Railroad was only the second railroad built in Ohio. The state
            legislature granted the Little Miami Railroad Company a charter in March 1836. The
            purpose was to connect the city of Cincinnati to Springfield. The line was completed
            between 1837 and 1848.</p>
         <p><strong>Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy</strong>:
            A private catholic women's school in Wheeling, WV established in 1848.</p>

         <h3 id="placesMentioned">Places Mentioned in Anderson's Letters</h3>This list includes the principle places mentioned in the letters.
         <p><strong>Augusta, KY</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.7667 -84.0000). 
            In his letter of 28 September 1862, Anderson reports that he has been ordered to
            take soldiers to Augusta in response to the Battle of Augusta, which took place the
            previous day.</p>
         <p><strong>Blennerhassett Island, WV</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            39.2667 -81.6167). 
            In his letter of 10 August 1862, Anderson describes having to lighten his ship's
            load to navigate around Blennerhassett Island, near Belpre, Ohio</p>
         <p><strong>Buffington Island, OH</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.9833 -81.7667). 
            In his letter of 10 August 1862, Anderson describes having to lighten his ship's
            load to navigate around Buffington Island, an island on the Ohio River in Jackson
            County, West Virginia north of Pomeroy, Ohio. Nearby in Ohio, the only battle to occur
            on Ohio soil during the American Civil War, the Battle of Buffington Island, took
            place on July 19, 1863.</p>
         <p><strong>Camp Portsmouth, OH</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.7167 -82.9833). 
            Camp Portsmouth served as a training and organizational camp from 1861-1862 for
            The 117th Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, the 1st Regiment Ohio Heavy Artillery,
            and
            the 18th Regiment Ohio Light Artillery.</p>
         <p><strong>Cincinnati, OH</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            39.1500 -84.4500). 
            Most of the letters in this collection were written from Cincinnati, an important
            stop for merchant boats on the Ohio River. When he is in Cincinnati, Anderson often
            visits Louisa's mother.</p>
         <p><strong>Gallipolis, OH</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.7833 -82.2000). 
            Anderson mentions several stops in Gallipolis in the summer of 1862 while handling
            government freight.</p>
         <p><strong>Graham's Station, OH</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.9667 -81.9000). 
            Graham's Station, Ohio was incorporated in 1841 and was later renamed Racine.
            Anderson refers to it by both names in letters written in August and September
            1862.</p>
         <p><strong>Lebanon, KY</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            37.5667 -85.2500). 
            In his letter of 5 October 1863, Anderson discusses the battle of Lebanon, writing
            that "the divel [sic] has broke loose over in Kentucky
            again" and caused great concern throughout the region.</p>
         <p><strong>Lexington, KY</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.0333 -84.5000). 
            In his letter of 5 July 1863, Anderson notes that General Morgan's forces were
            likely to take Lexington, but in fact they did not.</p>
         <p><strong>Licking River, KY</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            37.9333 -83.3000). 
            In his letter of 5 July 1863, Anderson mentions navigating a mile up the Licking
            River to deliver a load of metal.</p>
         <p><strong>Louisville, KY</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.2500 -85.7500). 
            Louisville was a regular stop for Anderson's boat, and in his letter of July 5,
            1863, he mentions Union plans to defend Louisville from Morgan's Raiders.</p>
         <p><strong>Maysville, KY</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.6333 -83.7333). 
            Maysville appears to have been a regular port of call for Anderson, as well as the
            home of a friend whose child's funeral he attend in October 1862.</p>
         <p><strong>Nashville, TN</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            36.1540 -86.7610 ). 
            In his letter of 1 July 1863, Anderson writes that he will start for Nashville,
            Tennessee that evening. Nashville could be reached from the Ohio River via the
            Cumberland River, which meets the Ohio at mile 933.</p>
         <p><strong>Parkersburg, WV</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            39.2667 -81.5500). 
            In his Letter of 24 August 1864, Anderson speculates about whether water levels
            will allow him to navigate as far upstream as Parkersburg, WV. Water levels appear
            to
            have been a constant threat to navigation on the Ohio at the time.</p>
         <p><strong>Pittsburgh, PA</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            40.4333 -79.9833). 
            The Ohio River begins at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in
            Pittsburgh, which appears to be the eastern terminus of Anderson's business, as well
            as his home.</p>
         <p><strong>Richmond, VA</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            37.540304 -77.433150). 
            The capital of the Confederate States of America. In his letter of 5 July 1863,
            Anderson is skeptical of calls to send men to Kentucky to protect Lexington and
            Louisville, believing that the real purpose of the call up is "to get recruits and
            then . . . march them on to Richmond."</p>
         <p><strong>Saint Louis, MO</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            38.6167 -90.1833). 
            Anderson writes only one of the letters in this collection from St. Louis—his
            letter of 19 June 1863—in which he notes that he prefers "the St Louis and Cin. trade"
            to the prospects on the "upper Mississippi."</p>
         <p><strong>Shousetown, PA</strong> (Lat/Long: 
            40.560833 -80.223200). 
            William and Louisa's homestead was in Shousetown, PA outside of Pittsburgh.</p>
